  <title>Relations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      This is chapter involves itself with one of most important concepts of all of mathematics. It is the concept of relationship. This concept has already been explored (immediatley very little as I tried my best to avoid it) in this course but has been a major component of your traditional mathmeatics education.

    <p>
      In this course it has been seen with the little we have done with inequalities and even addition, believe it or not, but what you will hopefully immediately notice is the relations you have the most experience with are functions. Using your the years of intuition when working with the more general concept of relation will serve you very well in this chapter.

<title>Direct Proof</title>

<p>
    Our first method before proving is known as direct proof, it is the student's go-to 
    throughout their career.  
</p>
<p>
    Most often we will be proving statements that look like: <me>P\implies Q</me>
</p>
<p>
    So, before we dive into it, I'd like to give the song that we will sing whenever we start proving.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>What's the P? (The "if" part)</li>
        <li>What's the Q? (The "then" part)</li>
        <li>What're the definitions?</li>
        <li>Now, what to do? (Which proving method - until we learn more this will always be direct proof)</li>
    </ul>

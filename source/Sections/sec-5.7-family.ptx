    <idx><h>family of sets</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>family</h></idx>
    We now consider, basic constructions like union, intersection and the cross product between many sets at once. We consider these over a <term>family of sets</term>, which is just a fancy way of saying a set whose members are sets. We will most often use the <em>script font</em> to indicate a family, for example <m>\mathscr{A}</m>.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-union-over-family">
<title>Union over a Family</title>
<idx><h>union</h><h>over a family</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>\mathscr{A}</m> be a family of sets. We define the <term>union over</term> <m>\mathscr{A}</m> as
            <me>
                \bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}} A=\{x\text{ }|\text{ }x\in A\text{ for some }A\in\mathscr{A}\}
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    As we are still learning setbuilder notation, to help us be able to unpack the condition in the previous definition, note the following condition of membership:
    <me>
        x\in\bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A\text{ }\text{ if and only if }\text{ }[\exists A\in\mathscr{A}\text{ }x\in A]
    </me>
</p>
<example>
<p>
    We now illustrate the union over a family with a Venn diagram below for the family of sets <m>\mathscr{R}=\{A,B,C\}</m>
</p>
<image source="/images/big_cup.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>

<example>
<p>
    Consider the family of sets <m>\mathscr{B}=\{R,S,T\}</m> where each set is defined as follows
    <me>
        R=\{1,3,G,\square,\triangle,\Omega\}
    </me>
    <me>
        S=\{\alpha, \Gamma, H, 7, 900\}
    </me>
    <me>
        T=\{1, \Gamma, \triangle, 200, 16\}
    </me>
    Thus the union over <m>\mathscr{B}</m> is
    <me>
        \bigcup_{B\in\mathscr{B}}B=\left(R\cup S\right)\cup T=\{1,3,G,\square,\triangle,\Omega, \alpha, \Gamma, H, 7, 900, 200, 16\}
    </me>
    
</p>
  
</example>
<p>
   Our next topic examines intersections within this new concept of families of sets.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-intersection-over-family">
<title>Intersection over a Family</title>
<idx><h>intersection</h><h>over a family</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>\mathscr{A}</m> be a family of sets. We define the <term>intersection over</term> <m>\mathscr{A}</m> as
            <me>
                \bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}=\{x\text{ }|\text{ }x\in A\text{ for every }A\in\mathscr{A}\}
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
   To help again we unpack the condition in the previous definition, note the following condition of membership:
    <me>
        x\in\bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A\text{ }\text{ if and only if }\text{ }[\forall A\in\mathscr{A}\text{ }x\in A]
    </me>
</p>
<example>
<p>
    We now illustrate the intersection over a fmaily with Venn diagram below, again, for the family of sets <m>\mathscr{R}=\{A,B,C\}</m>
</p>
<image source="/images/big_cap.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>


<example>
    <p>
    Consider the family of sets <m>\mathscr{B}=\{R,S,T\}</m> where each set is defined as follows
    <me>
        R=\{1,3,G,\square,\triangle,\Omega\}
    </me>
    <me>
        S=\{3, \alpha, \Gamma, H, \Omega, 900, \triangle\}
    </me>
    <me>
        T=\{1,3, \Gamma,\Omega, \triangle, 200, 16\}
    </me>
    Thus the union over <m>\mathscr{B}</m> is
    <me>
        \bigcap_{B\in\mathscr{B}}B=\left(R\cap S\right)\cap T=\{\Omega, 3, \triangle\}
    </me>
    </p>
</example>
<p>
    Now lets explore a general proof involving these constructions.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        <alert>Prove:</alert> For a non-empty family of sets <m>\mathscr{A}</m>
        <me>
            \bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A\subseteq\bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A
        </me>
    </p>
    <proof>
        <p>
            We begin as we do for any subset proof, and that is, we choose an arbitray element <m>x\in\bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            By definition of the intersection over a family for any member of the family <m>x</m> must belong to it. So choose an arbitrary <m>C\in\mathscr{A}</m> thus <m>x\in C</m>, which by defintion of union, since <m>x\in C</m> we have that <m>x\in\bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore since we chose an arbitrary element <m>x\in\bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A</m> and have shown <m>x\in\bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A</m>, we can conclude <m>\bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A\subseteq\bigcup_{A\in\mathscr{A}}A</m> as desired. <m>\square</m>
        </p>
    </proof>
</example>

<p>
    If this is still a bit too abstract for our dear reader we will now introduce a concept which allows us to look at these constructions a bit more like the summation from our calculus classes.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-indexed-family">
<title>Indexed Family of Sets</title>
<idx><h>indexed family of sets</h></idx>
<idx><h>index set</h></idx>

    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>\Delta</m> be a nonempty set such that for every <m>i\in\Delta</m> we correspond a set <m>A_i</m>. An <term>indexed family of sets</term> over <m>\Delta</m>, is the family of sets, 
            <me>
                \mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}
            </me>
            
            We call the set <m>\Delta</m> <term> the indexing set</term>.  
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    The most common case of an index set is when <m>\Delta\subseteq\N</m> in the form of 
    <me>
        \Delta=\{0,1,2,3,...,n\}
    </me>
     for some <m>n\in\N</m>, in this case we will often write the intersections as
     <me>
        \bigcap_{i\in\Delta}A_i=\bigcap_{i=0}^n A_i
     </me>
     and the union as
     <me>
        \bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i=\bigcup_{i=0}^n A_i
     </me>
     
</p>
<p>
    With this new construction lets visit another example.
</p>

<example>
    <p>
    Consider the indexing set <m>\Delta=\{0,1,2\}</m>, and the family of sets <m>\mathscr{C}=\{C_0,C_1,C_2\}</m> where each set is defined as follows
    <me>
        C_0=\left\{7,15,H,\triangle,\pi,\frac{1}{3}\right\}
    </me>
    <me>
        C_1=\left\{15, \triangle, \square, H, \frac{1}{3}, 0, \pi\right\}
    </me>
    <me>
        C_2=\left\{7,15, \Gamma,\frac{1}{3}, \pi, 0, 16\right\}
    </me>
    Thus the union over <m>\mathscr{C}</m> is

    <md>
        <mrow>\bigcap_{i\in\Delta}=C_i\bigcap_{i=0}^{2}C_i\amp =\left(C_0\cap C_1\right)\cap C_2</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\left\{\frac{1}{3}, 15, \pi\right\} </mrow>
    </md>
    </p>
</example>
<p>
    Of course this basic use case of an index set is far from the only one, in the next example we leave the case of a finite indexing set by setting <m>\Delta=\N</m>. To build these with ease, and to show the reader a use case from future mathematics courses where each set in our family is a subset of the real numbers.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the indexing set <m>\N</m> and the family of sets <m>\mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\N\}</m> defined as the following intervals,
        <me>
            A_i=\left[\left.\frac{1}{i+2},\frac{1}{i+1}\right.\right)=\left\{x\in\R\text{ }\left|\text{ }\frac{1}{i+1}\leq x\lt \frac{1}{i}\right.\right\}
        </me>
        thus we have
        <me>
            \bigcup_{i\in\N}A_i=\bigcup_{i=0}^\infty A_i=(0,1)=\left\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }0\lt x\lt 1\right\}
        </me>
        and
        <me>
            \bigcap_{i\in\N}A_i=\bigcap_{i=0}^\infty A_i=\emptyset
        </me>
    </p>
</example>
<p>
    In your next example we leave the natural numbers for our index set and instead explore the example where our indexing set of <m>\Q</m>.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the the indexing set <m>\Q</m>
        Now define the indexed family of sets <m>\mathscr{B}=\{B_n\text{ }|\text{ }n\in\Gamma\}</m>, defined as the following closed intervals,
        <me>
            B_\alpha=\big[\alpha,\alpha+1\big]=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }\alpha\leq x\leq \alpha+1\}
        </me>
        thus we have 
        <me>
            \bigcup_{\alpha\in\Q}B_\alpha=[0,\infty)=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }0\leq x \lt\infty\}
        </me>
        and 
        <me>
            \bigcap_{\alpha\in\Q}B_\alpha=\{0\}
        </me>
    </p>
</example>
<p>
    Now that we have built our intution on unions and intersections over families, lets prove a result about them.

<!--
<definition xml:id="def-product-over-family">

    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>n\in\N</m> and define <m>\Delta=\{1,2,...,n\}</m> and let <m>\mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}</m> be an indexed family of sets. We define the <term>Cross-Product over </term> <m>\mathscr{A}</m> as

-->
<example>
    <p>
        Let <m>\Delta</m> be an indexing set, and <m>\mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}</m> be an indexed family of sets.

        </me>
    </p>
    <proof>
        <p>
            This is a proof of the equality of two sets so we will need to break up the proof into two parts, namely we will need to show two subsets.

        </p>
        <p>
            To prove this we will start like most subset proofs, namely by choosing an arbitrary element <m>s\in B\cap \left(\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i\right)</m>. By the definition of intersection both <m>s\in B</m> and <m>s\in\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i</m>. By the definition of union over a family if we choose an arbitrary <m>j\in\Delta</m> we have <m>s\in A_j</m>, thus since <m>s\in B</m> and <m>s\in A_j</m> by the definitioun of intersection we have that <m>s\in B\cap A_j</m>. Because we chose <m>j\in\Delta</m> arbitrary it is true the for any <m>i\in\Delta</m> <m>s\in B\cap A_i</m> and hence the definition of union over a family is satisfied, that is 
            <me>
                s\in\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}(B\cap A_i)

        </p>
        <p>
            To prove this we will start like most subset proofs, namely by choosing an arbitrary element <m>y\in \bigcup_{i\in\Delta}(B\cap A_i)</m>. By definition of union over a family when we choose an arbitrary element <m>k\in\Delta</m> we must have that <m>y\in (B\cap A_k)</m> by definition of intersection this means that both <m>y\in B</m> and <m>y\in A_k</m>. Since we chose <m>k\in\Delta</m> arbitrarily we have shown that for any <m>i\in\Delta</m> that <m>y\in A_i</m> that is we have shown the definition of membership to a union over a family, namely that
            <me>
                y\in\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i
            </me>
            Yet, we have also shown that <m>y\in B</m>, thus by definition of intersection we have that
            <me>
                y\in B\cap\left(\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i)\right)
            </me>
            as desired.

        <p>
            Since we have shown both the subsets
            <me>
                B\cap \left(\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}A_i\right)\subseteq\bigcup_{i\in\Delta}(B\cap A_i)

            we can conclude the desired equality of:

    We finish up this section with a concept which will come into play when we discuss partions later in the course.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-pairwise-disjoint">
    <title>Pairwise Disjoint</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
           The indexed family <m>\mathscr{A} = \{A_\alpha | \alpha \in \Delta\}</m> of sets is <term>pairwise disjoint</term>
            if and only if for all <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m> in <m>\Delta</m>, either <me>A_\alpha = A_\beta</me>
            or
            <me>A_\alpha \cap A_\beta = \emptyset</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, the sets are completely the same, or completely different.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<example>
    <p>
        First consider the indexing set <m>\Delta=\{1,2,3\}</m> and the indexed family of sets <m>\mathscr{A}=\{A_1,A_2,A_3\}</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/yes_pair.jpeg" width="75%"/>

    <p>
        Next, consider the same index set of <m>\Delta=\{1,2,3\}</m> yet this time the indexed family <m>\mathscr{B}=\{B_1,B_2,B_3\}</m>

</example>
<p>
    We could not end the section without a proof, so here is your obligatory proof. 
</p>
<example>
    <p>
       Let <m>\Delta</m> be an indexing set, and let both <m>\mathscr{A}=\{A_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}</m> and <m>\mathscr{B}=\{B_i\text{ }|\text{ }i\in\Delta\}</m> be indexed family of sets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <alert>Prove:</alert> If <m>\mathscr{A}</m> is pairwise disjoint and <m>\mathscr{B}\subseteq\mathscr{A}</m> then <m>\mathscr{B}</m> is pairwise disjoint.
    </p>
    <proof>
        <p>
            We begin this proof by assuming our antecedent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume that <m>\mathscr{A}</m> is pairwise disjoint and <m>\mathscr{B}\subseteq\mathscr{A}</m>. It is our objective to prove that <m>\mathscr{B}</m> is pairwise disjoint, but looking above and seeing the definition of pairwise disjoint we see that we need to prove a universal quantifier, thus we choose arbitrary <m>j\in\Delta</m> and <m>k\in\Delta</m>. Now since we have assumed that <m>\mathscr{B}\subseteq\mathscr{A}</m> we have that both <m>B_j\in\mathscr{A}</m> and <m>B_k\in\mathscr{A}</m>, thus by definition of membership to <m>\mathscr{A}</m> we can find <m>s\in\Delta</m> and <m>t\in\Delta</m> so that <m>B_j=A_s</m> and <m>B_k=A_t</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we have assumed that <m>\mathscr{A}</m> is pairwise disjoint then either
            <me>
                B_j\cap B_k=A_s\cap A_t=\emptyset
            </me>
            or 
            <me>
                B_j=A_s=A_t=B_k
            </me>
            hence we have satisified the definition of pairwise disjoint of <m>\mathscr{B}</m>. <m>\square</m>
        </p>
    </proof>
</example>
<note>
    <p>
        For the proofs in this section we see a common <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m> that I like to call <em>chasing the definitions</em>, I know it can be jarring at first not having your warm and safe calculative muddle, but I promise you it will be ok! And I promise you in the next chapter there will <em>always</em> be a very solid calculative step!

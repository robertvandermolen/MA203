<title>Truth Tables</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        So far we have always looked at actual sentences, even when a letter like <m>P</m> was introduced it was immediately 
        followed by an actual statement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To recall our journey is to show/find the truth of statements, most often referred to as proofs. In this journey we will need to 
        combine propositions which we already know their truth value to arrive at new propositions which we want to be true. To be able to 
        do this we need to be able to know how combining different propositions with our connectives effect their truth value (truthiness).
        To keep track of this we now introduce truth tables.

  <title>What is a Relation?</title>
    <p>
      A relation at its heart is simple a way of formalizing the sentence Tillye is related to Nic, as Nic is Tillye's brother.
      
      Slightly more formal, we will take two sets and define how the elements of these sets are related to eachother.

                a subset of <m>A\times B</m> That is, <me>R\subseteq A\times B</me>

  <title>Well-Ordering Principle</title>
  <p>
    One of the most important properties of the natural numbers, that will be used constantly in your studies even if it is rarely mentioned and that is:
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Well-Ordering Principle (WOP)</title>
    <idx><h>Well-Ordering Principle</h></idx>
    <p>
      Every nonempty subset of <m>\N</m> has a smallest element.
    </p>
  </assemblage>
  <p>
    In class when I have introduced this topic in the past it has been greeted with the dreaded <em>wE</em><m>\ell</m><em>L oBv</em><m>I</m><em>oUsLy</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This property is quite unique to the natural numbers, it's not true in the integers, the rationals, the positive rational numbers, the real numbers, nor are the non-negative real numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    WOP seems to come up most often with contradiction, specifically assuming some property you to want to be true for the natural numbers is not. This is the negation of a universal statement, and thus you are assuming an existential, one way of interpreting this existential is to say that thus the set of all natural numbers that do not have this property is nonempty. Then WOP gives us a smallest member of this set, and we can quite often contradict by constructing a smaller element, for example. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For our first example and for the rest of this section we will need a couple of assumptions, firstly the following definitions
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-prime">
  <title>Prime Number</title>
  <idx><h>prime</h></idx>
  
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say an integer, <m>n</m>, is <term>prime</term> when the only divisors are 1 and <m>n</m> 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    and of course for the non-primes.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-not-prime">
  <title>Composite Integer</title>
  <idx><h>composite</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say an integer, <m>n</m>, is <term>composite</term> when it is not prime, that is when it has a divisor other than <m>1</m> and <m>n</m>. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <note>
    <p>
      Besides our usual assumptions we will also assume the properties of inequalities you know and love from your college algebra course as well (I usually skip these proofs in class but include them for reference to WOP in my later classes)
    </p>
  </note>
  <p>
    We will also find the next lemma useful for the following proofs.
  </p>
  <lemma xml:id="lem-divisor-less-than">
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> with <m>b\gt 0</m>, if <m>a|b</m> then <m>a\leq b</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <p></p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be arbitrary integers with <m>b\gt 0</m> and assume that <m>a|b</m>. By definition of divides we can find an integer <m>q</m> such that <m>b=aq</m>. Since we assumed that <m>b\gt0</m> we have that both <m>a\gt0</m> and <m>q\gt 0</m>. For sake of contradiction assume that <m>a\gt b</m>, hence <m>0\lt a-b</m> hence <m>0\lt a-aq=a(1-q)</m>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Since <m>a\gt0</m> then <m>0\lt (1-q)</m> hence <m>0\lt q\lt 1</m> thus <m>q=0</m> and hence <m>b=a\cdot q=a\cdot0=0</m> a contradiction to our assumption that <m>b\gt 0</m>, as specifically <m>b\neq0</m>.
      </p>
      
    </proof>
  <p></p>
  <example xml:id="ex-prime-factor">
    <p>
      <alert>Prove:</alert> Every natural number <m>n\gt1</m> has a prime factor.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Choose an arbitrary <m>n\in\N</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime then indeed <m>n</m> has a prime factor, namely itself. If <m>n</m> is composite then something other than <m>n</m> and <m>1</m> must divide <m>n</m>. Therefore the following set is non-empty:
        <me>
          R=\{m\in\N\text{ }|\text{ }m|n,\text{ }m\neq n, \text{ and }m\neq 1\}
        </me>
        By WOP, <m>R</m> has a smallest element, denote this element as <m>p\in T</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of contradiction assume that <m>p</m> is not prime, that is we assume that <m>p</m> is composite. By definition of composite we can find a divisor <m>d</m> such that <m>d\neq 1</m> and <m>d\neq p</m>, yet by definition of divides we can find a <m>k\in\Z</m> such that <m>p=dk</m> and we can find a <m>t\in\N</m> such that <m>n=tp</m>, thus <m>n=tdk</m>, therefore <m>d\in R</m> Yet by <xref ref="lem-divisor-less-than"/> we have that <m>d\leq p</m> yet we assumed <m>d\neq p</m> hence <m>d\lt p</m> a contradiction to <m>p</m> being the smallest element of <m>R</m>. <m>\square</m>

    We have used the next proposition without proof throughout the text, now we can finally present a proof here.

  <proposition xml:id="prop-div-algo">
    <title>The Division Algorithm</title>
    <idx><h>division algorithm</h><h>proof</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, with <m>a\neq 0</m>, there exists unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that 
        <me>
          b=qa+r
        </me>
        with <m>0\leq r\lt |a|</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>

  </p>
  <proof>
    <title>Proof of the Division Algorithm</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers with <m>a\neq0</m>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Consider the set:
      <me>
        S=\{b-ak\text{ }|\text{ }k\in\Z\text{ and }b-ak\geq0\}
      </me>
      Notice that if <m>0\in S</m> then we can find a <m>t\in\Z</m> such that <m>b-at=0</m> thus <m>b=at</m> and hence <m>t</m> plays the role of our desired <m>q</m> and we can simply set <m>r=0</m>. So we now assume that <m>0\not\in S</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 0 is not in <m>S</m>, then <m>b\neq0</m> as if <m>b</m> were zero then <m>b-a\cdot0= 0</m>. Now if <m>b\gt0</m> then <m>b-a\cdot 0\in S</m> and thus <m>S\neq\emptyset</m>, if <m>b\lt0</m> and <m>a\gt0</m> then <m>b-a\cdot(2b)\gt 0</m> thus <m>b-a\cdot(2b)\in S</m> and again <m>S</m> is not empty, if <m>a\lt 0</m> then the same can be said of <m>b-(-1)\cdot a\cdot(2b)</m>. Therefore <m>S\neq\emptyset</m> and hence we can use WOP to determine that there must be a smallest element, name this element <m>r</m>. By the definition of <m>S</m> we can find an integer <m>q</m> such that <m>r=b-aq</m>. Thus <m>b=aq+r</m> and <m>r\geq 0</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of contradiction assume that <m>r\gt |a|</m>, hence <m>r-a\gt 0</m> when <m>a\gt 0</m> and <m>r+a\gt0</m> when <m>a\gt 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <alert>Case 1:</alert> Assume <m>a\gt 0</m>
      </p>
      <p>
      Next note that <m>b-a(q-1)=b-aq+a=r+a\gt0</m> thus <m>b-a(q+1)\in S</m>, yet <m>b-a(q+1)\lt b-aq</m> a contradiction to <m>r</m> being the smallest member of <m>S</m>, hence <m>r\leq a=|a|</m> as desired. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Case 2:</alert> Assume <m>a\lt0</m>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Now note that <m>b-a(q-1)=b-aq+a=r+a\gt0</m> thus <m>b-a(q-1)\in S</m>, yet <m>b-a(q-1)\lt b-aq</m> a contradiction to <m>r</m> being the smallest member of <m>S</m>, hence <m>r\leq -a=|a|</m> as desired.

    <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title>
    <idx><h>fundamental theorem of arithmetic</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Every natural number greater than 1 is either prime or can be expressed as a product of primes.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
  </p>
  <proof>
    <title>Proof of The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</title>
    <p>
      For this proof we will use PCI
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>(i) (Base Case):</alert> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our base case is 2 in this example as we are trying to prove the statement for any <m>m\gt1</m>. So consider <m>2\in\N</m> by <xref ref="lem-divisor-less-than"/> anything that divides 2 must be less than or equal to 2, and hence it is either 1 or 2, and thus 2 is prime, hence we have established our base case. 
    </p>
    <p>
            <alert>(ii) (Induction Assumption):</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume we can find an <m>n\in\N</m> such that for any <m>t\in\N</m> such that <m>1\lt t\lt n</m> then <m>t</m> is either prime or can be expressed uniquely as a product of primes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>(iii) <m>\mathbf{\left(\text{Prove: }P(n)\right)}</m></alert>
        </p>
    <p>
      By <xref ref="ex-prime-factor"/> we can find an integer <m>q</m> and a prime number <m>p</m> such that <m>n=qp</m>. By <xref ref="lem-divisor-less-than"/> we have that <m>q\lt n</m>. If <m>q=1</m> then <m>n</m> is prime and we are done, so assume that <m>q\gt 1</m>. Since <m>1\lt q\lt n</m> by our induction assumption we can write <m>q</m> as a product of primes, denote this as <m>q=\prod_{i=1}^s p_i</m> for some <m>s\geq 1</m> and each <m>p_i</m> is a prime. Thus <m>n=\left(\prod_{i=1}^s p_i\right)\cdot p</m> hence we have written <m>n</m> as a product of primes.

<title>Direct Proof Example 5</title>
<introduction>
<p>Our last detailed example of a direct proof is a classic inequality. Inequalities will play
    a large role in your future analysis class.
</p>
<p><alert>Prove:</alert> For all positive real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, if 
    <m>a\lt b</m> then <m>b^2-a^2\gt 0</m>.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>a\lt b</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>b^2-a^2\gt 0</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
    <answer>
    <p><m>x</m> is positive mean <m>x\gt 0</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p>A direct proof! (it is the only method we know so far)</p>
    </answer>
    
    
    <p></p>

    <p>The Breakdown:</p>
    <p>
        <me>
            {\color{orange}{\forall x,y\in\R \text{ with }x\gt0\text{ and }y\gt0}}\text{ }{\color{red}{a\lt b}}\implies{\color{blue}{0\lt (b^2-a^2)}} 
        </me>
        
    </p>
    <p></p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-4-dir-example-five-begin" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{red}{\text{The Beginning}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        This beginning is the same as the others. We take care of the <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m> by:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be positive real numbers."
    </p>
    <p>
        For our approach of a direct proof we need to start by <m>{\color{red}{\text{assuming the }P}}</m>, that is:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Assume that <m>a\lt b</m>"
    </p>

    <title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        Now, as is in most inequality proofs first we need to work backwards. That is notice:
        <me>
            b^2-a^2=(b-a)(b+a)
        </me>
        by our allowed assumptions of basic <em>college algebra</em>. But we have that <m>b+a\gt 0</m> 
        since both <m>a\gt 0</m>, and <m>b\gt 0</m>, again with our assumptions of <em>college algebra</em>.
        That is we can, lets say, add <m>b</m> to the left side of <m>a\gt 0</m> and add 0 to the right side. Also,
        <m>b-a\gt 0</m> since subtracting <m>a</m> from both sides of our assumption results in <m>a\lt b</m>. 
    </p>

    <title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        To write our proof in a logical format we  will have to go the opposite direction, as otherwise we will have said
        our conclusion before we concluded it, essentially falling for circular reasoning, that is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Subtracting <m>a</m> from both sides of our assumption <m>a\lt b</m> we see that <m>b-a\gt 0</m>, and by adding
        <m>b</m> to the left and 0 to the right of <m>a\gt 0</m> we get that <m>b+a\gt 0</m>. Finally, since <m>b+a\gt0</m>
        we can multiply both sides of <m>b-a\gt0</m> by <m>(b+a)</m> and arrive at:
        <me>
            b^2-a^2=(b-a)(b+a)\gt0.
        </me>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's see everything written together in a single spot.
    </p>
    <example>
        
        
        <p><alert>Prove:</alert> For all positive real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, if 
            <m>a\lt b</m> then <m>b^2-a^2\gt 0</m>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be positive real numbers. Assume that <m>a\lt b</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since subtracting <m>a</m> from both sides of our assumption <m>a\lt b</m> we see that <m>b-a\gt 0</m>, and by adding
            <m>b</m> to the left and 0 to the right of <m>a\gt 0</m> we get that <m>b+a\gt 0</m>. Finally, since <m>b+a\gt0</m>
            we can multiply both side of <m>b-a\gt0</m> by <m>(b+a)</m> and arrive at:
            <me>
                b^2-a^2=(b-a)(b+a)\gt0.
            </me>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we assumed <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are positive real numbers and <m>a\lt b</m>, then we showed that <m>(b^2-a^2)\gt 0</m>,
            by direct proof we can conclude, that for all positive real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> if <m>a\lt b</m> then 
            <m>(b^2-a^2)\gt 0</m>. <m>\square</m>
        </p>
    </example>

<title>Our Terms</title>


    <p>Now, in order to start proving things we need the objects we are going to prove them about.
        In addition when we begin our journey in proving, I'd like to limit the moving pieces 
        to those few assumptions just listed, and <alert>most importantly</alert> these following definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
        I begin by being this limiting to make sure our playground is small enough that no one hurts themselves 
        by falling off monkey bars that are too high, but also large enough that we can actually
        get some <em>real</em> proving in. We'll start with a few common definitions, namely odd, even, and divides.
        </p>

    <p>
        <definition xml:id="defn-even">
            <title>Even</title>
            <idx><h>even</h></idx>
            <p >
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is <term>even</term> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k</m>
            </p>
        </definition>
    </p>

    <p>
        <definition xml:id="defn-odd">
            <title>Odd</title>
            <idx><h>odd</h></idx>
            <p >
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x</m> is <term>even</term> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> x=2k+1</m>
                
            </p>
        </definition>
    </p>

    <p>
        <definition xml:id="defn-divides">
            <title>Divides</title>
            <idx><h>divides</h></idx>
            <p >
                <m>\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}</m> and <m>y\in\Z</m>, we say <m>x</m> <term>divides</term>
                 <m>y</m> iff <m>\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}</m> such that <m> y=kx</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                The notation for <m>x</m> divides <m>y</m> is <m>x|y</m>
            </p>
        </definition>
    </p>
   

    <p>It is important to become so familiar with these that you could say them in your sleep.</p>

    <note>
        <p>
            <alert>Definitions</alert> are <alert>ASSUMPTIONS/PREMISES</alert>, so when using arguments from the previous
            chapter use them as such. 
        </p>

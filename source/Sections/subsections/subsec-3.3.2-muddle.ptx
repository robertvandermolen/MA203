<p>To proceed with our proof we don't have much except the definitions. 
    (It can be helpful, especially in these early stages of proof writing, to write the 
    relevant definitions to the side in your scratch work - this is why it's part of the song!)</p>
  <p>  From the definition of odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) we can make the conclusion that:</p> 
  <p><m>x</m> must look like: 
    <me>
    x=2k+1
  </me>
  for some integer <m>k</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Invoking this definition in this manner is an application of Existential Instantiation from 
    <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    To continue <em>muddling along</em> we can use some college algebra, as is allowed by <xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>
    and calculate:
  </p>
  <md>
    <mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
</md>
<p>The <m>x+1</m> on the left of this equation is the end conclusion we're <em>aiming</em> for! 
    (<em>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>"</em> from the song)</p>
<p> The stuff on the right is what we manipulate to make it 
    "look like," or "fit," the definition of even. We will attempt to make this more clear in the next subsection.
</p>

    <remark>
        <p>
            I choose these as the first <em>types</em> of proofs to show/have students do first, because the 
            <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m>
            is basically the same for all of them: "invoke a definition then calculate." It gives the students
            something to hold on to as they are still trying to digest the previous chapters...

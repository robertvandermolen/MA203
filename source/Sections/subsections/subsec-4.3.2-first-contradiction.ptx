    <title>First Example of Proof by Contradiction</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>
        For our first example of contradiction we will stick with our safety blanket of the integers. 
    </p>
    <p><alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> if <m>a- b</m> is odd 
        then <m>a+ b</m> is odd. </p>
    
    <p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
        <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p><m>a-b</m> is odd</p>
        </answer>
        <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p><m>a+ b</m> is odd</p>
        </answer>
        <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
        <answer>
        <p>even (<xref ref="defn-even"/>) and odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>)</p>
        </answer>
        <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p>Proof by contradiction - so we can try and learn it!</p>
        </answer>

    <p><alert>The Breakdown:</alert></p>
    <p>
        <me>
            {\color{orange}{\forall a,b\in\Z}}{\color{red}{\text{ if }a-b\text{ is odd then }a+b\text{ is odd.}}}

</introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="sec-4-3-2-example-begin" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <title><m>{\color{red}{\text{The Beginning}}}</m></title>
            <p>
                To begin our proof we first take care of the <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m>. As usual we will do this by choosing arbitrary integers, that is we will use language like:
            </p>
            <p>
                Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be arbitrary integers.
            </p>
         
            <note>
                <p>
                    Again be careful, even though we will be negating we DO NOT negate the quantifier!
                </p>
            </note>
            <p>
                Now to begin our proof by contraposition we need to <m>{\color{red}{\text{ Assume }\sim R}}</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                But <m>R</m> is not in our song! Yes that's true, but <m>R</m> is just "what we want to prove". In this example we want to prove if <m>a- b</m> is odd then <m>a+ b</m> is odd. So we will need to assume <m>{\color{red}{\sim (\text{if }a-b\text{ is odd then }a+b\text{ is odd})}}</m> or using our analysis above we will:
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume that <m>a-b</m> is odd yet <m>a+b</m> is not odd. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now this is false, and it is our job to confirm that, yet a reader with no warning might be very alarmed that you began your proof with such a blatantly false assumption. To quell our reader's troubled stomach, and let them know what we're doing, we can start the sentence with: 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sake of contradiction...
            </p>
            <p>
                Or for those more inclined to the classics we can simply at the beginning of our proof write:
            </p>
            <p>
                [RAA] 
            </p>
            <p>
                which stands for <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, that is, "reduction to absurdity."
            </p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="sec-4-3-2-example-muddle" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
            <title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
            <p>
                Next, almost right away we can react almost with <em>knee jerk</em> and play off our assumption with:
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we assumed that <m>a+b</m> is not odd, by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that <m>a+b</m> is even.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, again, as if we were to <em>knee jerk</em> we could then apply our definitions of even (<xref ref="defn-even"/>) and odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) with language similar to:
            </p>
            <p>
                By the definition of odd we can obtain an integer <m>\ell</m> so that <m>a-b=2\ell+1</m>. As well, by the definition odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) we are able to select an integer <m>s</m> so that <m>a+b=2s</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, this is where our quick reactions or just using the definitions we have sung in our song ends. In other examples we would look to the quintessential <m>Q</m> as our target to set up a calculation. Unfortunately in a proof by contradiction we are in search of a brand new proposition (which we have lovingly named <m>T</m>) further more we also need to find its negation (<m>\sim T</m>). This search is not always easy, and where to begin isn't always clear. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For this example we wandered in the woods and simply added the two things from our assumption together...
            </p>
            <p>
                Calculate:
                <md>
                    <mrow>(a-b)+(a+b)\amp=(2\ell+1)+(2s)</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=2\ell+2s+1</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=2(\ell+s)+1</mrow>
                </md>
                and similar to many proofs that came before this we can conclude that since <m>\ell+s</m> is an integer by the definition of odd, we have that <me>T:\text{ }(a-b)+(a+b)\text{ is odd}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
                But, there is of course another way of calculating this sum with no consideration of these newly found integers, <m>\ell</m> and <m>s</m>, that is...
                <me>
                    (a-b)+(a+b)=(a+a)+(b-b)=2a
                </me>
                yet, since <m>a</m> is an integer by the definition of even we have that <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is even, or in light of <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have:
                <me>
                    \sim T: \text{ }(a-b)+(a+b)\text{ is not odd}
                </me>
                Therefore we have stumbled upon our contradiction, our <m>T</m> <em>and</em> not <m>T</m>.
            </p>

        <subsection xml:id="sec-4-3-2-example-end" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
                <title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
            <p>
                Now that we have found our contradiction of <m>T\wedge (\sim T)</m> we should make sure to point out this contradiction just in case our reader missed this, letting everyone know we have come to <m>{\color{blue}{\text{the end}}}</m> of our proof by contradiction. We, of course, can do this by following numerous linguistic paths but we must choose one so:
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is an integer and cannot be both even and odd, which is a contradiction. Thus using proof by contradiction we have successfully shown that for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> if <m>a- b</m> is odd 
                then <m>a+ b</m> is odd. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual we collect it in our tldr boxes...
            </p>
            <example>
                <p><alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> if <m>a- b</m> is odd 
                    then <m>a+ b</m> is odd. </p>
                <p>
                    Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be arbitrary integers. For the sake of contradiction assume that <m>a-b</m> is odd yet <m>a+b</m> is not odd. Since we assumed that <m>a+b</m> is not odd, by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that <m>a+b</m> is even. By the definition of odd we can obtain an integer <m>\ell</m> so that <m>a-b=2\ell+1</m>. As well, by the definition odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) we are able to select an integer <m>s</m> so that <m>a+b=2s</m>. Calculate:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>(a-b)+(a+b)\amp=(2\ell+1)+(2s)</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=2\ell+2s+1</mrow>
                        <mrow>\amp=2(\ell+s)+1</mrow>
                    </md>
                    since <m>\ell+s</m> is an integer by the definition of odd, we have that <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is odd. Yet, we can also calculate as: <me>
                        (a-b)+(a+b)=(a+a)+(b-b)=2a
                    </me>
                    yet, since <m>a</m> is an integer by the definition of even we have that <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is even, or in light of <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is even.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, <m>(a-b)+(a+b)</m> is an integer and cannot be both even and odd, which is a contradiction. Thus using proof by contradiction we have successfully shown that for all integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> if <m>a- b</m> is odd 
                    then <m>a+ b</m> is odd.

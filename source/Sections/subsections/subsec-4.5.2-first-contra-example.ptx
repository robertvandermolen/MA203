<title>First Example of Proof by Contraposition</title>
<p>
    For our first example, just as in <xref ref="sec-4-2-direct-proof"/>, we will give as many <em>gory</em> 
    details as we can think of to help the eager student of proofs.
</p>
    <p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>\forall m \in \mathbb{Z} </m> if <m>m^2</m> is odd, then <m>m</m> is odd.</p>

    <p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
        <p>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p><m>m^2</m> is odd</p>
        <p>
            But... for this question we need to really know the <m>\sim P</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>m</m> is not odd odd
        </p>
        </answer>
        <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p><m>m</m> is odd</p>
        <p>
            But... again... for this question we need to really know the <m>\sim Q</m>:
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>m^2</m> is not odd odd
        </p>
        </answer>
        <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
        <answer>
        <p>Odd and even! (found in <xref ref="subsec-4-1-2-terms"/>)</p>
        </answer>
        <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
        <answer>
        <p>Proof by contraposition - because we are trying to learn it</p>
        </answer>

    <p><alert>The Breakdown of the orginal:</alert></p>
    <p>
        <me>
            {\color{orange}{\forall m\in\Z}}\text{ if }{\color{red}{m^2 \text{ is odd }}}\text{ then }
            {\color{blue}{m\text{ is odd}}}
        </me>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><alert>The Breakdown of the contrapositive:</alert></p>
    <p>
        <me>
            {\color{orange}{\forall m\in\Z}}\text{ if }{\color{blue}{m \text{ is not odd }}}\text{ then }
            {\color{red}{m^2\text{ is not odd}}}
        </me>
    </p>    
    <p></p>

    <p>
       <note>
        <p>
            When first getting used to the contrapositive students have at times made the mistake of negating the <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m>
            which in this case would be <m>\exists m\in\Z</m>. Be careful as the statment actually has the form <m>\forall m\in\Z</m> <m>R(m)</m> where
            <me>
                R(m):\text{ if }m^2 \text{ is odd then }
                m\text{ is odd}

        using the guidance of <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/> by choosing an arbitrary element, with language like:</p> 
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>m</m> be an integer

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Pick an integer <m>m</m>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Take any integer <m>m</m> of your choice
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let <m>m</m> be a freely chosen integer
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Assume <m>m</m> is an integer, chosen arbitrarily 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Designate an integer <m>m</m> of arbitrary selection
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Grab yerself any ol' integer, and let it be called <m>m</m>!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Hark! Select an integer, and let it bear the name <m>m</m>, chosen as thou wilt
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Pick an integer, any integer, and call it <m>m</m>. Doesn't matter which—it could be lurking anywhere, but <m>m</m> is the one we'll follow
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Aye, take <m>m</m>, an integer, any integer, 
                        an <m>m</m> of no particular choosing but of the choosing all the same—floating through the mind like a thought barely caught, 
                        yet caught still: <m>m</m> it is.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
       Now we take care of our <m>{\color{red}{\text{beginning}}}</m> of our proof using this new method of proof by contrapostion, 
       by assuming <m>{\color{red}{\sim Q}}</m>.</p>
    <p>Assume <m>m</m> is not odd.</p>
    <p>
        Now, many of you may be reading this last line yelling with your fist in the air saying, "who says not odd, just say even". 
        Yet, we must of course consult our <em>allowed assumptions</em> section (<xref ref="sec-4-1-what-we-assume-ch-04"/>) and the assumption
        that "not odd" is equivalent to "even" is not one of those!

<section xml:id="sec-3-5-2-example-muddle" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
<p>
    As the pain point of even vs odd is not lost to me and it will be helpful to be able to write proofs without having to
    prove that not odd is the same as even every single time. This want to not prove something over and over again, or 
    to seperate a smaller proof from a different result comes up a lot, so when we want to do this we create a Lemma. 
</p>    
<historical>
    <p>
        The word <em>Lemma</em> comes from the Ancient Greek λῆμμα, (perfect passive εἴλημμαι) 
        something received or taken. Thus something taken for granted in an argument.
    </p>
</historical>
<lemma xml:id="lem-odd-not-even">
    <statement>
        <p>
           Let <m>y</m> be an integer, then <m>y</m> is either even or odd.
        </p>
    </statement>
</lemma>
<proof>
    <p>
        By the division algorithm
            (<xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>) we can find integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that 
            <m>0\leq r\lt 2</m> such that <m>y=2q+r</m>. Yet since <m>r</m> is an integer and <m>0\leq r\lt 2</m> 
            and the only integers which satisfy this inequality
            are 0 and 1, we are left only with <m>y=2q+0=2q</m> (even) or <m>y=2q+1</m> (odd). 
    </p>
</proof>
<p>
    With our assumption that <m>m</m> is not odd and this Lemma in hand we could use Disjunctive Syllogism (<xref ref="argument-types"/>) 
    in our proof we could write:
</p>
<p>
    Since we assumed that <m>m</m> is not odd by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we can conclude that <m>m</m> is even.
</p>
<p>
    Now we finally have in our proof that <m>m</m> is even so we can go back to what we have come accustomed to: using the definitions. 
    Specifically in this example we could write something like:
</p>
<p>Thus by definition of even we can find an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>m=2k</m></p>
<p>
    Then, we could continue <em>following our nose</em> to do the common muddle so far in this text, and that is to <em>calculate</em>.
</p>
    <p>Calculate:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>m^2\amp=(2k)(2k)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(2k^2)</mrow>
    </md>
</section>

<section xml:id="sec-3-5-2-example-end" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
<title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
<p>
    From the <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m> we have that 
    <me>
        m^2=2(2k^2)
    </me>
    from the definitoin of even (<xref ref="defn-even"/>) we can now conclude:
</p>    
<p>Since <m>2k^2</m> is an integer, according to the definition of even, <m>m^2</m> is even.</p>
<p>
    Now this is not exactly what we want to conclude. We want to conclude that: <m>{\color{green}{m^2\text{ is not odd}}}</m> 
    so again using Disjunctive Syllogism (<xref ref="argument-types"/>) and our newest lemma we could write:
</p>
<p>
    Because we have concluded that <m>m^2</m> is even by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we can now conclude that <m>m^2</m> is not odd.
</p>
    <p>Finally, we can write our wrap up sentence!</p>
    <p>Hence, by proof by contraposition if <m>m^2</m> is odd then m is odd. <m>\square</m></p>

    <p>Now let's see everything written together in a single spot.</p>
<example>

    <p><alert>Prove:</alert> For any integer <m>m</m>, if <m>m^2</m> is odd, then <m>m</m> is odd.</p>
    <p>Let <m>m</m> be an integer. Assume <m>m</m> is not odd. Hence, by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we can conclude that <m>m</m> is even.</p>
    <p>
        By definiton of even we can find an integer <m>k</m> such that <m>m=2k</m>
    </p>
    <p>Calculate:</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>m^2\amp=(2k)(2k)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(2k^2)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
        Since <m>2k^2</m> is an integer, according to the definition of even, <m>m^2</m> is even. 
        Because we have concluded that <m>m^2</m> is even by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we 
        can now conclude that <m>m^2</m> is not odd.
    </p>
    <p>Hence, by proof by contraposition if <m>m^2</m> is odd then m is odd. <m>\square</m></p>
</example>

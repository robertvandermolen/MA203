<p>
    One purpose of our fun song is for us to to split what we want to prove into the <m>{\color{red}{\text{Beginning}}}</m>
    and the <m>{\color{blue}{\text{End}}}</m>.
</p>
<p>
     Once we have it split like that we see something left over... this is the 
    <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m>. This quantifier is quite often forgotten/assumed when it is not
    written, but assumed nonetheless. Therefore, we call it the <em>hidden quantifier</em>. Either way the statement we are trying to prove is
    now broken up as follows:
    <me>
        {\color{orange}{\forall x\in\Z}}\text{ if }{\color{red}{x\text{ is odd}}}\text{ then }{\color{blue}{x+1\text{ is even}}}
    </me>
    
</p>
<p>To prove our statement with this  <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m>, according to 
    Universal Generalization from <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/> we need to show it works with an
arbitrary integer.</p>

<p>To indicate this in our proof we may begin with either of the sentences:</p>
    <p> "Let <m>x</m> be an integer."</p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p>"Choose an arbitrary integer <m>x</m>"</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Now, we can take care of the <m>{\color{red}{\text{Beginning}}}</m> from the direct proof:
    </p>
    <p>Assume the "<m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>"</p> 
    <p>"<m>{\color{red}{\text{Assume that }x\text{ is odd}}}</m>."</p>
    <p></p>

<title>Direct Proof Example 3</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    The last two examples had even in the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m> and even in the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>. 
    In fear of students thinking this is some sort of immutable law/pattern lets change that pattern 
    this time.
</p>
<p>
    <alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd
    then <m>x\cdot y</m> is odd.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd</p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>x\cdot y</m> is odd</p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
    <answer>
    <p>Odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>)!</p>
    </answer>
    <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p>A direct proof! (it is the only method we know so far)</p>
    </answer>
    
    
    <p></p>
    <p>The Breakdown:</p>
    <p>
        <me>
            {\color{orange}{\forall x,y\in\Z}}\text{ if }{\color{red}{x \text{ and }y\text{ are both odd}}}
            \text{ then }{\color{blue}{x\cdot y \text{ is odd.}}}

<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-2-dir-example-three-begin" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{red}{\text{The Beginning}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        We begin by taking care of our leading quantifier, <m>{\color{orange}{\forall x,y\in\Z}}</m>, 
        trying our best to never forget <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>. To do this we could use a variety of english statements to do this, 
        for example:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    "Select two random integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>"
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    "Choose two arbitrary integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>"
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    "Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers"
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we do the <m>{\color{red}{\text{first step}}}</m> of a direct proof, that is, <m>{\color{red}{\text{assume the }P}}</m>.
        From our song we already know this, and that is:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Assume <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd"
    </p>

<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-2-dir-example-three-muddle" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        Now, as we see in this first class of proofs so often, the only tools we really have at our disposal are the definitions from <xref ref="subsec-4-1-2-terms"/>. 
        In this proof we have to apply a definition twice from our previous line/assumption namely: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>x</m> is odd
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <m>y</m> is odd
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Something that bears repeating over and over and over and over again, is to always remember <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>. Right now we need to remember 
        this because the definition of odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) invokes an existential quantifier. 
        So to apply the definition of odd for <m>x</m> we can use language like:
    </p>
    <p>
        "We can find an <m>a\in\Z</m> so that <m>x=2a+1</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
        To use the definition of odd for our <m>y</m> we can use language like:
    </p>
    <p>
        "We can also find a <m>b\in\Z</m> so that <m>y=2b+1</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that we have used our definitions we can move to our usual <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m> where we use some good ol' <em>college algebra</em>. 
        In a more general look at proofs as a whole, you should keep in mind what we are trying to conclude, i.e. the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>, namely 
        that <m>{\color{blue}{x\cdot y\text{ is odd}}}</m>. So we should calculate <m>{\color{blue}{x\cdot y}}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Calculate:
    </p>
    <md>
        <mrow>{\color{blue}{x\cdot y}}\amp=(2a+1)\cdot(2b+1)</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=4ab+2a+2b+1</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=2(2ab+a+b)+1</mrow>
    </md>

<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-2-dir-example-three-end" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        From the <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m> we now have: <me>
            x\cdot y=2{\color{purple}{(2ab+a+b)}}+1
        </me>
        Now, using the definition of odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) and of course <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/> we can conclude from the 
        <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m> that <m>x\cdot y</m> is odd, as <m>2ab</m> is an integer and thus <m>{\color{purple}{(2ab+a+b)}}</m> is an integer, and hence we have that
        <m>x\cdot y</m> is an integer times 2 then plus one.
    </p>

   
    <p>
        Now let's see everything written together in a single spot, with a proper wrap-up.
    </p>
    <example>
       
        
        <p>
            <alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd
            then <m>x\cdot y</m> is odd.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select two random integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Assume that <m>x</m> is odd and <m>y</m> is also odd. By definition of even
            we can find an integer <m>a</m> so that <m>x=2a+1</m>. Also, by the definition of odd we can find an integer <m>b</m> so that 
            <m>y=2b+1</m>. Now we calculate:
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>x\cdot y\amp=(2a+1)\cdot(2b+1)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=4ab+2a+2b+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2(2ab+a+b)+1</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            Now since <m>2ab+a+b</m> is an integer, we see that <m>x\cdot y</m> is odd. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To summarize, since we chose arbitrary integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> which we assumed were both odd, respectively, by direct proof
            we proved that for all integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, if <m>x</m> is odd and <m>y</m> is odd, then <m>x\cdot y</m> is odd. <m>\square</m>
        </p>
    </example>

<title>The Existential Quantifier</title>

<p>
  Consider the predicate <m>3x=12</m> is, again, not a proposition as it depends on the universe and which <m>x</m> from this
  universe we are talking about. But, there is a way of not choosing an <m>x</m> from the universe to turn this into
  a proposition, that is to consider the statement: <me>\text{There is an } x \text{ such that }3x=12</me> This proposition is 
  still treated differently than other propositions we have considered, as it still depends on the universe. This new
  proposition can be formed from the predicate by applying a quantifier, that is we qualify our open sentence before saying 
  it.

  <statement>
    <p>
      For a predicate <m>P(x)</m>, the sentence <me>\exists x\text{ } P(x)</me> is read <me>\text{"There exists an }x\text{ such that }P(x)\text{"}</me>
      or <me>\text{"For some }x,\text{ }P(x)\text{"}</me> or <me>\text{"We can find an }x\text{ so that }P(x)\text{"}</me>
      The proposition <m>\exists x \text{ }P(x)</m> is true iff the truth set of <m>P(x)</m> is nonempty. The symbol <m>\exists</m>
      is called the <term>existential quantifier</term>
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
<p>
  One way to show that <m>\exists x\text{ }P(x)</m> is true for a specific universe is to identify an object <m>a\in\mathcal{U}</m>
  such that <m>P(a)</m> is true. 
</p>
<example>
<idx><h>existential quantifier</h></idx>
  <idx><h>exists</h></idx>
  <idx><h>quantifier</h><h>existential</h></idx>
  <p>
    For this example lets consider the following predicates
  </p>
  <ol marker="(A)">
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>P(x): x \text{ loves books}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>Q(x): x \text{ eats pizza}</m>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>R(x): x \gt 4</m>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    For (C) the statement <m>\exists x\text{ }R(X)</m> is true in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{R}</m> is true as 
    <m>4.5\in\mathbb{R}</m> as well as many other numbers. In statement (A) there are no real numbers that have any 
    opinions on books for my understanding, but if the universe was all people then <m>\exists x\text{ }P(x)</m> is true 
    as I am a person and I love books. Similarly for (B) the proposition, <m>\exists x\text{ }Q(x)</m> in the universe
    of all people is also true, as I also eat pizza! 
  </p>
</example>
<p>
  In English there are many ways to say the existential quantifier, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      "some"
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      "at least one"
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      "there is"
    </p>
  </li>
 
</ul>
<p>
  and so many more.
</p>

<p>
  I'd like to end this subsection with the symbolization of a statement <me>\text{Some }P(x)\text{ are }Q(x)</me> which should be
  <me>(\exists x)(P(x)\wedge Q(x)</me>
</p>

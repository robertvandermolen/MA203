    <ol marker="(A)">
        <li>
            <p>
                For every Indiana resident <m>x</m> is older than 18, <m>x</m> can vote
                <me>(\forall x)(x\text{ Indiana resident }\wedge x\text{ is older than 18 }\wedge x\lt 10\implies x\text{ can vote}</me>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some functions defined at 0 are not differentiable at zero
                <me>(\exists f)(f\text{ is defined at }0\wedge f\text{ is not differentiable at }0</me>
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Some students are math majors and some students are buisnesss majors

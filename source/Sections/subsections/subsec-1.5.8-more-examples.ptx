        <li>
            <p>
                For every Indiana resident <m>x</m> older than 18, <m>x</m> can vote
                <me>(\forall x)(x\text{ Indiana resident }\wedge x\text{ is older than 18 }\wedge x\lt 10)\implies x\text{ can vote}</me>

        <li>
            <p>
                Some functions defined at 0 are not differentiable at zero

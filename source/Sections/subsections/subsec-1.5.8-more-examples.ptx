<title>Examples in Context</title>
<p>
    Now we will give some more examples of using quantifiers in sentences
</p>
<p></p>
<example>
    <ol marker="(A)">
        <li>
            <p>
                Every Indiana resident <m>x</m> at least 18 years old, <m>x</m> can vote
                <me>(\forall x)(x\text{ Indiana resident }\wedge x\text{ is at least 18 years old })\implies x\text{ can vote}</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some functions defined at 0 are not differentiable at zero
                <me>(\exists f)(f\text{ is defined at }0\wedge f\text{ is not differentiable at }0)</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some students are math majors and some students are business majors
                <me>(\exists x)(x\text{ is a math majors})\wedge(\exists y)(y\text{ is a business major})</me>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Some Students major in math and accounting.
                <me>
                    (\exists x )(x\text{ is a math major}) \wedge(x\text{ is an accounting major}) 
                </me>
                
            </p>

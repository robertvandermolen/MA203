<title>What are Cases?</title>

<p>
    Unlike the example in <xref ref="sec-1-2-checking"/> where the are an unlimited amount of integers to choose from, 
    sometimes we have a finite and more tenable collection of possibilities and we could actually check or prove in each 
    of these situations.
</p>

    <p>
        The following is the basic <em>shape</em> of a proof by cases. 
    </p>
    <assemblage>
        <title>Proof by Cases</title>
        <idx><h>proof by cases</h></idx>
        <p>
          <alert>Case 1:</alert> a proof of the first case
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>Case 2:</alert> a proof of the second case
          </p>
          <p>
            <m>\vdots</m>
          </p>
          <p>
            <alert>Case n:</alert> a proof of the <m>n^{\text{th}}</m> case
          </p>
      </assemblage>
<p>
    At its most basic a proof by cases is an istance of proofs "Assuming an Or" from <xref ref="subsec-3-5-proofs-of-or"/> where one is tasked to prove <m>(P\vee R)\implies Q</m>, then we would split the problem into proving <m>P\implies Q</m> as our <em>first case</em> and then <m>R\implies Q</m> as our <m>second case</m>. For examples of this the reader is reffered to <xref ref="subsec-3-5-proofs-of-or"/>.
</p>
      <p>
        Another common place a proof by cases comes up are when we are trying to prove propositons in the form of:
        <me>
            \forall x\text{ }P(x)
        </me>
        for some predicate <m>P(x)</m>.
        There are many common places that proof by cases in the previous form come up, for example the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>\forall x\in\Z</m> we have either <m>x</m> is even or <m>x</m> is odd.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>\forall x,y\in\Z</m> either <m>x|y</m> or <m>x|(y-r)</m> for some integer <m>0\lt r\lt |x|</m> 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>\forall x\in\R</m> either <m>x\geq 0</m> or <m>x\lt0</m>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <p>
            We have already proven that the first point is true in <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/>. For the second point, a more general result, we provide the following lemma.
        </p>
        <lemma xml:id="lem-remainders">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    For any two integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, there exists an <m>r\in\Z</m> such that <m>0\leq r\lt |x|</m> and <m>x|(y-r)</m>
                </p>
            </statement>
        </lemma>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers. By the division algorithm from <xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>
                we can find a <m>q,r\in\Z</m> such that <m>0\leq r\lt |x|</m> and <m>y=qx+r</m>. Hence subtracting both sides
                by <m>r</m> we get <m>y-r=qx</m> since <m>q</m> is an integer by the definition of divides (<xref ref="defn-divides"/>)
                we have that <m>x|(y-r)</m>.  
            </p>
        </proof>
    
        <p></p>

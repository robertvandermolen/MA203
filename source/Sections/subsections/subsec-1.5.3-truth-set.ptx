<title>Truth Sets and Predicate Forms</title>

<p>
    When we are discussing a general universe of discuourse we will denote it as <m>\mathcal{U}</m>. We will also often need 
    to speak of a predicate in general terms so we will use the <em>function</em> notation for predicates. Such
    as for the predicate <m>x\geq 3</m> we can denote it by <m>P(x)</m>. And thus we can now determine that a statment like
    <m>P(2)</m> which is <m>2\geq3</m> is false.
</p>
<p>
    <idx><h>truth set</h></idx>
    <idx><h>predicate</h></idx>
    After setting our universe can now talk about the <term>truth set</term> of a predicate <m>P(x)</m>, that is
    collecting all of the elements of our universe that make <m>P(x)</m> true. 
</p>


<example>
    <idx><h>truth set</h></idx>
    <p>
        
        The truth set for the open sentence "<m>x^2\lt 3</m>" depends on the universe of discord. When the universe is set 
        as <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{N}</m> 
    
        then the truth set is <m>\{0,1\}</m>. When the universe is 
        <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}</m>
        
        
        then the truth set is <m>\{-1,0,1\}</m>. If the universe was to be <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{R}</m>
         then the truth set would be the open interval <m>(-\sqrt{3},\sqrt{3})</m>. 
    
    </p>

</example>

<definition xml:id="def-equiv-predicate">
    <title>Equivalent Predicates</title>
    <idx><h>predicate</h><h>equivalent</h></idx>
    <idx><h>equivalent</h><h>predicate</h></idx>
    
    <statement>
        <p>
            For a fixed universe of discord, we say that two predicates, <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>, are 
            <term>equivalent</term> iff they have the same truth set.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will denote this as <m>P(x)\equiv Q(x)</m>
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    Now lets see an example of this in play wiht some, perhaps, unexpected results.
</p>
<example>
<idx><h>predicate</h><h>equivalent</h></idx>
    <idx><h>equivalent</h><h>predicate</h></idx>
    <p>
        The predicates <m>P(x): x^2+2x=-1</m> and <m>Q(x):x\leq 1</m> are equivalent in the universe 
        <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}^+</m>. They are not equivalent in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}</m>.
    </p>
</example>
<p>
    This next example should work the way you expected.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        The open statements <m>R(x):x^2=9</m> and <m>S(x):x=3</m> are equivalent in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{N}</m>
        but they again are not equivalent in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}=\mathbb{Z}</m>
    </p>
</example>

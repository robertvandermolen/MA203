<title>Direct Proof Example 4</title>
<introduction>
<p>Now let's see an example that is <em>not</em> even nor odd.</p>
<p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>\forall x,y\in\Z</m> if <m>5|x</m> and <m>5|y</m> then <m>5|(x-2y)</m></p>
    
  

<p></p>
<p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>5|x</m> and <m>5|y</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>5|(x-2y)</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
    <answer>
    <p>divides (<xref ref="defn-divides"/>)</p>
    </answer>
    <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p>A direct proof! (it is the only method we know so far)</p>
    </answer>
    
    
    <p></p>
    <p>The Breakdown:</p>
    <p>
        <me>
           {\color{orange}{\forall x,y\in\Z}}\text{ }  {\color{red}{5|x \text{ and } 5|y}} \implies {\color{blue}{5|(x-2y)}}
        </me>
        
    </p>
    <p></p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-3-dir-example-four-begin" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{red}{\text{The Beginning}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        This proof is the same as we have been doing at the beginning, as it starts with our <m>{\color{orange}{\text{beginning quantifier}}}</m>. 
        As usual we take care of that using:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers."
    </p>
    <p>
        As we are still doing a direct proof, our first step involving this is <m>{\color{red}{\text{Assume the }P}}</m>, and for 
        this example it is:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Assume that both <m>5|x</m> and <m>5|y</m>."
    </p>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-3-dir-example-four-muddle" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        In this example we go to our definitions again (being careful for the quantifier <xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>), specifically
        for <m>5|x</m> we use the definition of divides (<xref ref="defn-divides"/>) as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        "By definition of divides we can find an <m>a\in\Z</m> so that <m>x=5a</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
        For <m>5|y</m> we apply the definition of divides (<xref ref="defn-divides"/>) as:
    </p>
    <p>
        "By definition of divides we can find a <m>b\in\Z</m> so that <m>y=5b</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
        Something I have seen students do here is write "exists an integer <m>b</m>." You are using the existential quantifier to produce 
        a specific integer (<xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>), by saying exists you are just telling me that you could theoretically find 
        one, not telling that you are producing one to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        So now that we have something we can use, like usual we can calculate:
    </p>
    <md>
        <mrow>{\color{blue}{(x-2y)}}\amp=(5a)-(2\cdot(5b))</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp=5(a-2b)</mrow>
    </md>
</subsection>

<subsection xml:id="sec-4-4-3-dir-example-four-end" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
    <p>
        From the<m>{\color{green}{\text{ muddle }}}</m>we have
        <me>
            x-2y=5{\color{purple}{(a-2b)}}
        </me>
        and then we can reference a couple of our assumptions from <xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume"/>, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
        "Since <m>2b</m> is an integer a <m>{\color{purple}{a-2b}}</m> is an integer by the definition of divides
        5 divides <m>x-2y</m>."
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's see everything written together in a single spot, with an appropriate wrap-up.
    </p>
    <example>
       
        
        <p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>\forall x,y\in\Z</m> if <m>5|x</m> and <m>5|y</m> then <m>5|(x-2y)</m></p>

        <p>
            Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be integers. Assume that 5 divides both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Next, we calculate:
        </p>
        <md>
            <mrow>{\color{blue}{(x-2y)}}\amp=(5a)-(2\cdot(5b))</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=5(a-2b)</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>
            Since <m>2b</m> is an integer it follows that <m>a-2b</m> is an integer, thus by the definition of divides, 5 divides <m>x-2y</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To summarize, since we chose arbitrary integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> and assume that 5 divides both of them, and have shown that <m>5|(x-2y)</m>,
             by direct proof we have shown that for any integers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, if <m>5|x</m> and <m>5|y</m> then <m>5|(x-2y)</m>.<m>\square</m>
        </p>
    </example>

<title>The Universe of Discourse</title>

<p>
    As many of you have assuredly yelled at the book by now, of course I can determine from context what we are talking about.
    But this is exactly the point of this next section, that before starting a discussion you must set your context. What we 
    will call our <term>universe of discourse</term>. 
</p>

<p>
    The univese of discourse is our first example of a <term>set</term>. 
</p>
<p>
    So that we handle this playground with the respect it
    deserves, we will give the a very brief introduction to the topic, just what we need. We will dive deeper into set theory
    and use it as one of our discourse examples later on in the book!
</p>

<p>Let's start with the very basics and <em>define</em> some things.</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><term>Set</term>: A collection of stuff (or nothing).</li>
      <li><term>Element</term>: The stuff in the set.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The elements in a set do not have a particular order, so you can think of a set like a "magical bag" 
    that holds things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Set theory, like everything, comes with its own special notation. We often denote sets with a capital letter, 
    and elements with a lower case letter.
  </p>
  <p>
    The symbol <m>\in </m> can be read as "in" or "is an element of" or "is a member of" 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, "<m>x \in A</m>" would be read as "<m>x</m> is in <m>A</m>," or, "<m>x</m> is an element of the set <m>A</m>", or 
    "<m>x</m> is a member of the set <m>A</m>"
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Besides just arbitrarly naming a set in attempts to define a set we can also describe what is the set by
    capturing all the elements in the set between the symbols <m>\{</m> and <m>\}</m> then listing the elements
    seperated by commas. For example is we just wanted to collect the following numbers in a set: <me>A=\{3,7,8,9\}</me>
    Or if we were to collect the set of all counting numbers we could use ... to indicate continuing a pattern: 
    <me>\{1,2,3,...\}</me> We could also use what is known as set builder notation:

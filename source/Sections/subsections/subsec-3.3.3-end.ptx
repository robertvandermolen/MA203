    <p>
        From the <m>{\color{green}{\text{muddle}}}</m>, we have:
        <me>
            x+1=2{\color{purple}{(k+1)}}
        </me>
        
    </p>
        
        <p> To be able to make our conclusion <me>{\color{blue}{Q}}:\text{ } x+1 \text{ is even}</me> 
            we must use definition of even (<xref ref="defn-even"/>), which uses an existential 
        quantifier, so we must (<xref ref="how-to-quantifiers"/>) be able to produce/point at an
        integer, so that <m>x+1</m> is this integer times 2.</p>
<p>We have exactly that, because (<xref ref="sec-4-1-1-what-we-assume" />) <m>{\color{purple}{k+1}}</m> is an 
    integer!</p>

    <p>
        To write this in our proof we can say: 
    </p>

    <p>
        "Since <m>{\color{purple}{k+1}}</m> is an integer (this is where/how we "assume but mention" the <em>closure of addition in the integers</em>), by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even."</p>
    

    
    <p>Finally we should end every proof with a wrap-up sentence. This sentence is to summarize the proof, most 
        importantly laying out your proving method, in this example a direct proof. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For this proof our wrap-up could look like:
    </p>
    <p> "Since we assumed that an arbitrary integer <m>x</m> was odd and showed that <m>x+1</m> is even, we can conclude 
        that for all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even, by direct proof." 
    </p> 
    <p>
        At last we indicate that our proofs are over with a: 
        <me>
            \text{ QED }
        </me>
        
    </p>

    
   
    <historical>
    <p>When a proof is finished, customarily, we either write "QED" or <m>\square</m> at the bottom. 
        This comes from the Latin "quod erat demonstrandum," which means 
        "that which was to be demonstrated."</p>
    </historical>


<p></p>
<p>
    To wrap-up everything in a pretty bow, let's see the whole proof in one spot.
</p>




<example>
    <p> <alert>Prove:</alert> For all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Let <m>x</m> be an integer. Assume <m>x</m> is odd. 
    Thus, by the definition of odd, we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that 
    <m>x=2k+1</m>.</p> 
    <p>Calculate:</p>
    <md>
    <mrow>x+1\amp=(2k+1)+1</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp=k+2</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>x+1</m> is even. </p>
    <p> Since we assumed that an arbitrary integer <m>x</m> was odd and showed that <m>x+1</m> is even, we can conclude 
    that for all integers <m>x</m>, whenever <m>x</m> is odd then <m>x+1</m> is even, by direct proof. <m>\square</m>
    </p> 
    
    </example>

  <title>The Bad and the Ugly</title>
<p>
    There are many ways to make a valid argument, and many ways to make an invalid argument. As a student of proofs
    it is inevitable that you will make all of the mistakes, and find new and amazing ways of
     making invalid arguments, it is unavoidable. But, don't fret, that is the beautiful learning journey you are on! 
</p>

<p>
  A very common mistake that students will make when arguing is 
  what is known as <term>circular reasoning</term>.
</p>
<assemblage permid="pOu">
  <title>Catch 22</title>
  <p>
    <term>Circular reasoning</term> or <term>begging the question</term>
      or <term>catch 22</term> happens when we <em>assume</em> the
      statement we are trying to conclude. 
    </p>
</assemblage>
<historical>
  <p>
    The term <em>Catch 22</em> was coined by the character Doc Daneeka, 
    an army psychiatrist, in the novel <em>Catch 22</em>,
    to describe a governmental loophole that prevented pilots 
    from requesting a mental evaluation to avoid dangerous missions. 
  </p>
</historical>
<p>
  This fallacy comes from the very valid argument:
</p>
<p>
  <tabular halign="center">
 
    <row  bottom="minor">
      <cell><m>P</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\therefore \text{ }P</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
</p>
<p>
  It's just this argument doesn't get you very far.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the next example of circluar reasoning.
</p>
<example>
  <p>
   Say I was trying to conclude that a number <m>x</m> is even, then circular
   reasoning would be: "Assume that <m>x</m> is even, thus <m>x</m> is even"
  </p>

</example>
<p>
  Another mis-step that stuents are bound to take is almost a mis-application of
  the contrapositive, or thinking the implication is stronger
  than it is.
</p>
<assemblage permid="pOu">
  <title>Denying the Antecedent</title>
  <p permid="vSb">
    <term>Denying the antecedent</term> is the invalid argument
  </p>
  <p>
    <tabular halign="center">
      <row>
 <cell><m>P\implies Q</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row  bottom="minor">
        <cell><m>\sim P</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><m>\therefore \text{ }\sim Q</m></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </p>
  
</assemblage>
<p>

  Recall that the contraposition is <me>[P\implies Q]\equiv[(\sim Q)\implies(\sim P)]</me>
  but not <m>(\sim P)\implies(\sim Q)</m>.
   </p>
   <example>
    <p>
      Consider the statment: "If it is sunny then we will go on a bike ride". 
      then we still might go on a bike ride if it's not sunny, I was 
      just saying if it's sunny we will definitely go!
    </p>
   </example>
 <p>
  Another mistake in a similiar fashion again mistaking the power
  of the implication. 
 </p>
 <assemblage permid="pOu">
  <title>Affirming the Conclusion</title>
  <p permid="vSb">
    <term>Affirming the conclusion</term> is the invalid argument
  </p>
  <p>
    <tabular halign="center">
      <row>
      <cell><m>P\implies Q</m></cell>
    </row>
           <row  bottom="minor">
             <cell><m>Q</m></cell>
           </row>
           <row>
             <cell><m>\therefore \text{ }P</m></cell>
           </row>
         </tabular>
  </p>
  
</assemblage>
<p>
  Recall that <m>Q\implies P</m> is NOT 
  the same as <m>P\implies Q</m>.
</p>
<example>
  <p>
    Consider the statment: "If it is sunny then we will go on a bike ride". 
    then just because go on a bike ride doesn't some how make it sunny, again I was 
    just saying if it's sunny we will definitely go!

<title>Biconditional Proofs</title>
<p>
    Proofs of statements with a biconditional are ubiquitous in mathematics. As you have seen all of our definitions are biconditional statements. We use the biconditional to me mean equivalent. These equivalences in future math classes give tools for proving conditions without working to more intuitive definitions, instead by giving more usable ones. 
</p>
<p>
    You can prove biconditionals in many ways; the one we will take time to examine the what I tell my students is the "safe way". It is the two-way proof.

        Therefore, <m>P\iff Q</m>

  <p>
    That this proof method is valid follows from the fact that the following is an equivalence:
    <me>
        [P\iff Q]\equiv [(P\implies Q)\wedge(Q\implies P)]
    </me>
    to verify this equivalence we have the following truth table.

    For our next examples we spare the reader the in-depth treatment as it is simply two direct proofs.
</p>
    <example>
        
        <p><alert>Prove:</alert> <m>a</m> is odd if and only if <m>a+1</m> is even.</p>
        <proof>
        <p>Let <m>a</m> be an integer</p>
        <p>[<m>\implies</m>] (if <m>a</m> is odd then <m>a+1</m> is even)</p>
        <p>Assume <m>a</m> is odd. Hence, by definition of odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that <m>a=2k+1</m></p>
        <p>Calculate</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>a+1\amp=2k+1+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2k+2</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2(k+1)</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>Since <m>k+1</m> is an integer, by definition of even, <m>a+1</m> is even. Hence by direct proof, 
            if <m>a</m> is odd then <m>a+1</m> is even.</p>
        <p>[<m>\impliedby</m>] (if <m>a+1</m> is even, then <m>a</m> is odd)</p>
        <p>Assume <m>a+1</m> is even. Hence, by definition of even we can find an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a+1=2m</m></p>
        <p>Calculate:</p>
        <md>
            <mrow>a+1\amp=2m</mrow>
            <mrow>a\amp=2m-1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2m-1-1+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2m-2+1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=2(m-1)+1</mrow>
        </md>
        <p>Thus, since <m>m-1</m> is an integer, by definition of odd, <m>a</m> is odd. Thus by direct proof if <m>a+1</m> 
            is even, then <m>a</m> is odd.</p>
        <p>Since we showed by direct proof that if <m>a</m> is odd then <m>a+1</m> is even <alert>and</alert> if <m>a+1</m> is even, 
            then <m>a</m> is odd, then <m>a</m> is odd <alert>if and only if</alert> <m>a+1</m> is even.<m>\square</m></p>
        </proof>
    </example>
    <example>
        <p>
            <alert>Prove:</alert> For any integer <m>a</m>; <m>a</m> is odd if and only if <m>a^3</m> is odd.
        </p>
        <proof>
            <p>
                Let <m>a</m> be arbitrary integer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>[\implies]</m> (if <m>a</m> is odd then <m>a^3</m> is odd)
            </p>
            <p>
                Assume that <m>a</m> is odd, by the definition of odd (<xref ref="defn-odd"/>) we can find an integer <m>k</m> so that <m>a=2k+1</m>. Now calculate:
                <md>
                    <mrow>a^3\amp=(2k+1)^3</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=(2k+1)(2k+1)(2k+1)</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=(4k^2+4k+1)(2k+1)</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=8k^3+12k^2+6k+1</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp 2(4k^3+6k^2+3k)+1</mrow>
                </md>
                since <m>(4k^3+6k^2+3k)</m> is an integer <m>a^3</m> is odd.
            </p>
            <p>
                <m>[\impliedby]</m> (if <m>a^3</m> is odd then <m>a</m> is odd.)
            </p>
            <p>
                For the sake of contraposition assume that <m>a</m> is not odd, thus by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that <m>a</m> is even. By the definition of even we can find an integer <m>t</m> so that <m>a=2t</m>. Now calculate:
                <me>
                    a^3=(2k)^3=8k^3=2[4k^3]
                </me>
                since <m>4k^3</m> is an integer, we can conclude <m>a^3</m> is even, thus by <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that <m>a^3</m> is not odd. Therefore by contraposition we have that if <m>a^3</m> is odd then <m>a</m> is odd.
            </p>
        </proof>
    </example>
<p>
    There is another method for proving an <em>if and only if</em> statement it is not recommended for the student who is just starting their proving journey, but for completeness I would be remiss if I did not include it. 
</p>

<assemblage>
    <title>One-Way Proof of <m>P\iff Q</m></title>
    <p>
      <m>P</m> iff <m>T_1</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <m>T_1</m> iff <m>T_2</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>T_{n-1}</m> iff <m>T_n</m>
      </p>
      <p>
        <m>T_n</m> iff <m>Q</m>
      </p>
  </assemblage>
  <p>
    The reason I warn beginning students away from this is that too often students get it in their head that the faster way is better, in calculus they see the limit definition for the derivative then learn the power rule and say to themselves well I'm never going back to the limit. 
</p>
<p>
    Again for the sake of completion we provide an example, the diligent hard working student will do their best to see why a backwards proof would be <em>boring</em>.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        <alert>Prove:</alert> For any two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>; <m>a^2\lt -b^2</m> if and only if <m>(a-b)^2\lt-2ab</m>
    </p>
    <proof>
        <p>
            Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be arbitrary integers, not that
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>a^2\lt -b^2</m>
        </p> 
        <p>
            if and only if
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>a^2+b^2\lt 0</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            if and only if
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>a^2+b^2-2ab\lt-2ab</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            if and only if
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>(a-b)^2\lt-2ab</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore <m>a^2\lt -b^2</m> if and only if <m>(a-b)^2\lt-2ab</m>
        </p>
    </proof>
</example>

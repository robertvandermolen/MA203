  <title>Bijections</title>
  <p>
    The concept of something being the same as something else is ubiquitous in mathematics. In this course we have already seen that equals is not as easy as it may of first seemed when dealing with sets. The bijection is how we go about in our combinatorics, algebra, and many other classes to show two objects we are studying are the <em>same</em>.

      A function that is surjective just needs to hit every element in the codomain. Consider the two sets

        A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}

    <p>
      Consider the function <m>f:\Z\times\Z\rightarrow\Z</m> from <xref ref="ex-is-a-function"/> defined as

      </me>
      <alert>Prove:</alert> <m>f</m> is surjective
    </p>
    <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The definition of surjective involves an equality of sets, so we break our proof into two parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Rng}(f)\subseteq\Z}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>c\in\text{Rng}(f)</m> by definition of range we can find an <m>(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z</m> such that <m>f(a,b)=c</m>, yet by definition of <m>f</m> we have that <m>f(a,b)=3a+2b</m>, since both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are integers we can conclude that <m>3a+2b</m> is an integer and thus <m>c\in\Z</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Rng}(f)\supseteq\Z}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>z\in\Z</m>, by <xref ref="prop-div-algo"/> we can find two integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>0\leq r\lt 3</m> such that <m>q=3z+r</m>. Since <m>0\leq r\lt 3</m> we have that <m>r=0</m> or <m>r=1</m> or <m>r=2</m>, splitting our proof into 3 cases
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Case 1:</alert> Assume <m>r=0</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case since <m>q\in\Z</m> and 0 is also an integer we have that <m>z=3q+2\cdot0</m> hence <m>f(q,0)=z</m> and thus <m>z\in\text{Rng}(f)</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Case 2:</alert> Assume <m>r=1</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          For this case note that <m>r=1=3-2</m> hence <m>q+1</m> and -1 are integers we have that <m>z=3q+3-2=3(q+1)+(-1)\cdot 2</m> hence <m>f(q+1,-1)=z</m> thus <m>z\in\text{Rng}(f)</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Case 3:</alert> Assume <m>r=2</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case since <m>q</m> and 1 are integers we have that <m>z=3q+2</m> hence <m>f(q,1)=z</m>, therefore <m>z\in\text{Rng}(f)</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we have shown no matter what <m>r</m> is that <m>z\in\text{Rng}(f)</m> we can conclude that <m>z\in\text{Rng}(f)</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have shown both <m>\text{Rng}(f)\subseteq\Z</m> and <m>\text{Rng}(f)\supseteq\Z</m> we can conclude <m>\text{Rng}(f)=\Z</m>, therefore we have shown that <m>f</m> is surjective.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    Before we jump into our next example, lets shed a little light on composing functions.
  </p>
  <assemblage>
    <title>Composing Functions</title>
    <p>
      Once again functions are just relations, thus we have already defined how to compose them. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
      For example considering three sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> and two functions <m>f:A\rightarrow B</m> and <m>g:B\rightarrow C</m> we can then consider the composition <me>g\circ f:A\rightarrow C</me>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      When we were dealing with relations we would have taken a pair <m>(a,c)\in g\circ f</m> to only be a member of <m>g\circ f</m> when we could find an element <m>b\in B</m> such that <m>(a,b)\in f</m> and <m>(b,c)\in g</m>, with a function this element is self evident, it is <m>f(a)</m> since <me>(a,b)\in f</me> means <me>f(a)=b</me>. 
      Furthermore, since <m>\text{Dom}(f)=A</m> we know we have such a <m>b</m> (another reason that the notation <m>f(a)</m> even makes sense). 
      </p>
      <p>
      That is we interpret the composition of functions as 
      <me>
        g\circ f(x)=g(f(x))
      </me>
       
    </p>
  </assemblage>
  <example>
    <p>
      Let <m>f:A\rightarrow B</m> and <m>g:B\rightarrow C</m> be functions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <alert>Prove:</alert> If <m>g\circ f</m> is surjective then <m>g</m> is surjective
    </p>
    <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Assume that <m>g\circ f</m> is surjective. To prove that <m>g</m> is surjective we need to show an equality of sets, so break it into the usual parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Rng}(g)\subseteq C}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>y\in\text{Rng}(g)</m> by definition of range we can find an <m>x\in B</m> such that <m>g(x)=y</m> hence by definition of <m>g</m> we have that <m>g(x)\in C</m> as desired. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Rng}(g)\supseteq C}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>c\in C</m>, since we have assumed that <m>g\circ f</m> is surjective, in particular <m>C\subseteq\text{Rng}(g\circ f)</m> we have that <m>c\in\text{Rng}(g\circ f)</m> thus by definition of range we can find a <m>a\in A</m> such that <m>g\circ f(a)=c</m>, that is <m>g(f(a))=c</m>, and by definition of <m>f</m> we have that <m>f(a)\in B</m>, hence we have that <m>c\in\text{Rng}(g)</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have shown both <m>\text{Rng}(g)\subseteq C</m> and <m>\text{Rng}(g)\supseteq C</m> we can conclude that <m>\text{Rng}(g)= C</m>, hence we have shown that <m>g</m> is surjective.

      A function that is injective just needs that no two inputs hit the same output. Consider, again, the two sets

      Consider the function <m>f:\Z\rightarrow\Z</m> defined for any <m>a\in\Z</m> as

    <proof>
      <p>
        We leave the task of proving that <m>f</m> is indeed a function to the reader, and we prove that <m>f</m> is injective.

        Let <m>x\in\Z</m> and <m>y\in\Z</m> such that <m>f(x)=f(y)</m> by definition of <m>f</m> this means <m>x+5=y+5</m>, subtracting five on both sides of the equation gives us <m>x=y</m> as desired.

  Notice that the function from <xref ref="ex-surj-numbers"/> is <alert>not</alert> one-to-one since <m>6=f(2,0)=f(0,3)</m> yet <m>(2,0)\neq(0,3)</m>.

  <proof>

      Assume <m>f: A \hookrightarrow B</m> and <m>g: B \hookrightarrow C</m>. Let <m>x\in A</m> and <m>y\in A</m> such that

      By definition of function we can have that <m>f(x)\in B</m> <m>f(y)\in B</m>.

      By assumption that <m>g\circ f(x) = g\circ f(y)</m>, that is <m>g(f(x)) = g(f(y))</m>. By our assumption that <m>g</m> is one-to-one, <m>f(x)=f(y)</m>. Thus, by our assumption that <m>f</m> is one-to-one, <m>x=y</m>. Hence <m>f\circ g</m> is one-to-one

      Assume <m>f</m> is one-to-one. We have defined the inverse of a relation in <xref ref="def-inverse"/>, so what we want to show is that <m>f^{-1}</m> is a function. To show a relation is a function we need to show that it satisfies both conditions to being a function.

        <p>
          Let <m>m\in\Z</m>, note to show that we have membership of <m>\text{Rng}(g)</m> we need to produce an integer so that <m>g</m> maps this new integer to <m>m</m>. This is an existential, and the way we produce this element in unimportant to the proof. Notice that since <m>m</m> and 2 are integers we have that <m>m+2</m> is an integer, and notice that <m>g(m+2)=m+2-2=m</m> and hence by definition of range we have that <m>m\in\text{Rng}(g)</m> as desired.

          Because we have shown that <m>\text{Rng}(g)\subseteq\Z</m> and <m>\text{Rng}(g)\supseteq\Z</m> we can conclude that <m>\text{Rng}(g)=\Z</m>, therefore we have that <m>g</m> is onto as desired.

      Since we have shown that both <m>\text{Rng}(g\circ f)\subseteq C</m> and <m>\text{Rng}(g\circ f)\supseteq C</m> we can conclude <m>\text{Rng}(g\circ f)= C</m> so that we can conclude that <m>g\circ f</m> is onto as desired.

      Thus, <m>g\circ f: A \rightarrow C</m> is a bijection.

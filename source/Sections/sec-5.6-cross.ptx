<title>Cross Product</title>
<p>
    In this section we introduce the concept of cross product. This is yet another way of making new sets from old sets.

        <p>
            Given two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we can define a new set which we will call the <term>cross product</term> of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> (or the <term>cartesian product</term>) defined as:
            <me>
                A\times B=\{(a,b)\text{ }|\text{ }a\in A\text{ and }b\in B\}
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    This is the collection of all ordered pairs. We explore this new construction in the following examples.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a_for_cross.jpeg" width="45%"/>
     <image source="/images/b_for_cross.jpeg" width="54%"/>
    <p>
        thus the cross product is the following set:
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a_cross_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
</example>
<p>
    Our next example explores the lack of commutation of the cross product.
</p>
<example>
    <p>Let's look at another cross product of some sets. Calculate <m>A\times B</m> and <m>B\times A</m> given the sets <m>A = \{2, G, E\}</m>
    and <m>B = \{\pi , e, P\}</m></p>

    <me>A\times B = \{(2, \pi), (2, e), (2, P), (G, \pi), (G, e), (G, P), (E, \pi ), (E, e), (E, P)\}</me>
    <me>B\times A = \{(\pi , 2), (\pi , G), (\pi , E), (e, 2), (e, G), (e, E), (P, 2), (P, G), (P, E)\}</me>
</example>
<p>
    You've actually seen the cross product since very early on in your mathematical education. Generally, the ordered pairs you would consider were the cartesian plane, the good ol' <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        This time if we consider a set I've tried very hard to stay away from, namely the real numbers, <m>\R</m>, then the cartesian plane is the set <m>\R\times \R</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout your youth you have surely seen many points illustrated on this cartesian plane, such as the elements <m>{\color{red}(1,3)}</m>, <m>{\color{blue}(2,-2)}</m>, and <m>{\color{green}(-2,-1)}</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/r_cross_r.jpeg" width="100%"/>
</example>
<p>
    With this basic understanding of the cross-product, we are ready to start proving with it.
</p>
<example>
<p>
    <alert>Prove:</alert>

        For sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m>, if <m>A\subseteq C</m> and <m>B\subseteq D</m> then <m>A\times B\subseteq C\times D</m>
    </p>
    <proof>
    <p>
        We begin by assuming that <m>A\subseteq C</m> and that <m>B\subseteq D</m>. Our objective is to prove that <m>A\times B\subseteq C\times D</m>, that is, we need to show a subset. We do this by choosing an arbitrary element, <m>x\in A\times B</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand this element, we of course refer to the definition (<xref ref="def-cross-product"/>), from which we see the defining condition promises that we can find two elements, one from <m>A</m> and one from <m>B</m>. Name these elements, <m>a\in A</m> and <m>b\in B</m>, such that <m>x=(a,b)</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        By our assumption that <m>A\subseteq C</m>, since we established <m>a\in A</m>, by definition of subset we get that <m>a\in C</m>. Similarly, by our assumption that <m>B\subseteq D</m> and since we established that <m>b\in B</m> again by the definition of subset <m>b\in D</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, by the definition of cross product <m>x=(a,b)\in C\times D</m> as desired. <m>\square</m>
    </p>
    </proof>
</example>

    <example>
    <p>
        <alert>Prove:</alert>
   
            Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets, then <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>
        </p>
  
  <proof>
    <p><alert>[Want to show: <m>\mathbf{A\times (B\cup C)\subseteq(A\times B)\cup(A\times C)}</m>]</alert></p>
    <p>
        We begin by choosing an arbitrary element <m>x \in A \times (B\cup C)</m>. By the definition of cross product, we can find <m>m \in A</m> and <m>\ell \in B\cup C</m> such that 
        <m>x = (m, \ell)</m>. By definition of union, <m>\ell \in B</m> or <m>\ell \in C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
         Hence <m>(m, \ell) \in A \times B</m>, when <m>\ell\in B</m>, or <m>(m, \ell) \in A \times C</m>, when <m>\ell \in C</m>. Thus, by definition of union, <m>x=(m, \ell) \in (A \times B) \cup (A \times C)</m>
        Thus by definition of subset, since <m>x \in A\times (B\cup C)</m> and <m>x \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>, hence we have that
        <m>A\times (B\cup C) \subset (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>.
    </p>
    <p><alert>[Want to show: <m>\mathbf{(A\times B)\cup(A\times C)\subseteq A\times (B\cup C)}</m>]</alert></p>
    <p>This time, let <m>y \in (A \times B)\cup (A\times C)</m>. Hence by definition of union, <m>y \in (A\times B)</m> or <m>y \in (A\times C)</m>. Hence, by definition
        of cross product, we can find <m>s\in A</m> and <m>t \in B</m> such that <m>y=(s, t)</m> <alert>or</alert> <m>d\in A</m> and <m>r\in C</m> such that <m>y=(d, r)</m>.</p>
    <p><alert>Case 1:</alert> <m>\mathbf{y=(s, t)}</m></p>
    <p>Since <m>t\in B</m>, by definition of union, <m>t\in B\cup C</m>. And since <m>s\in A</m>, <m>y=(s, t) \in A\times(B\cup C)</m>, by definition of 
        cross product. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>y \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>y \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>, therefore we can conclude that
        <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m></p>
    <p><alert>Case 2:</alert> <m>\mathbf{y = (d,r)}</m></p>
    <p>Since <m>l\in C</m>, by definition of union, <m>r\in B\cup C</m>. And since <m>d\in A</m>, by definition of cross product,
        <m>y=(d,r) \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>. Thus by definition of subset, since <m>y \in (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> and <m>y \in A\times (B\cup C)</m>, thus we have
        <m>(A\times B)\cup (A\times C) \subset A\times (B\cup C)</m> </p>
    <p>Thus, since both cases hold, by direct proof and proof by cases, <m>A\times (B\cup C) = (A\times B)\cup (A\times C)</m> <m>\square</m></p>
  </proof>

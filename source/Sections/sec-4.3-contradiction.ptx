<title>Contradiction</title>
<p>Our next method for proving is known as proof by contradiction. It is an extremely powerful example of 
    an indirect proof. It plays off the concept of the excluded middle, in more plain language a statement is either true of false and nothing between.

<historical>
    <p>
        The excluded middle is also known as the law / principle of the excluded third, in Latin principium tertii exclusi. Another Latin designation for this law is tertium non datur or "no third [possibility] is given".

<title>Obviously</title>
<p>
    When writing a proof a challenging task is to decipher what is obvious. The rule I make in my class is that you 
    should write so that ANYONE in the class would have no questions as to how you got to the next step. 

</p>
<p>
    Just to make things extra fun (and by fun, I mean slightly confusing), there will be moments when 
    I'm pretty sure every single one of you will look at a step and think, "Well, obviously!" But then the next homework 
    assignment will be to prove that very statement. 
</p>
<p>
    There will be moments where you are absolutely NOT allowed to just say, "Oh, that's obvious!" 
    Furthermore, I will be very clear (especially at the beginning) on what you are allowed to take as given/obvious 
    and everything else must be proven!

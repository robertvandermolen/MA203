<title>What is a Set?</title>
<p>
    While set theory has been rigourously defined axiomatically, in this course we choose to only skim the surface using a whole lot of intution and the propositional logic that we devoloped in <xref ref="ch-02-logic"/>. The main object of study in set theory is the <em>set</em>. Inutuitively a set is a magic bag filled with stuff... or nothing... Georg Cantor the russian mathematician credited as the father of set theory first defined the set as:
</p>
<p>
     A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thoughtâ€”which are called elements of the set.
</p>

<p>
    We include a much more boring description.
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-naive-set">
    <title>Set</title>
    <idx><h>set</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            A <term>set</term> is a well definied collection of objects. 
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<definition xml:id="def-element-of-a-set">

    <idx><h>set</h><h>member</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The objects in a set are called <term>elements</term> or <em>members</em>.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    We will most often denote sets with captial letters like: <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m> etc. Furthermore we will denote elements with lowercase letters like <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>x</m>, etc.

    <title><m>\in</m> Notation</title>
    <p>
      To indicate that <m>x</m> is an element of a set <m>A</m> we will write:
      <me>
        x\in A
      </me>
      To indicate that <m>x</m> is not an element of a set <m>A</m> we will write:
      <me>
        x\not\in A
      </me>
      
    </p>
  </assemblage>
  <p>
    Membership to a set is a <alert>proposition</alert> as it is either true or false. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To define a specific set we can simply list all of it's elements. To do so we encompass the elements we wish to include between braces: <m>\{</m> and <m>\}</m> and seperate the elements with a comma.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the following set <m>A</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        and note the following example of the membership notation.
    </p>
    <image source="/images/robot.jpeg" width="37%"/>
    <p>
        You can also indicate the negation of membership
    </p>
    <image source="/images/bob_not_in.jpeg" width="37%"/>
  </example>
  <note>
    <p>
        A set has no order, and you cannot repeat elements.
    </p>
  </note>
  <definition xml:id="def-cardinality">
  <title>Cardinality</title>
  
  
    <statement>
      <p>
        For a set <m>A</m> we call the <term>cardinality</term> or <term>order</term> of <m>A</m> is the number of elements in the set <m>A</m>, denoted as
        <me>
          |A|
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In this course we will only mention this concept when the sets are finite, when sets are infinite the cardinality of a set flurishes a beautiful theory, one which we will not dive into in this text but is quite amazing.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      Consider the following set
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="90%"/>
    <p>
      We see that the number of elements in the set <m>A</m> is 4 hence, <m>|A|=4</m>.
    </p>

    
  </example>
  <p>
    Sets come in many different shapes and flavors and throughout your mathematical career you will need to become extremely comfortable with sets and depending on the discipline you will either love or hate the following set but you will never deny that it is perhaps one of the most important sets. 
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-empty-set">
    <title>Empty Set</title>
    
    <idx><h>emptyset</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            We will call the set containing no elements the <term>empty set</term>, we denote the empty set as <m>\emptyset</m>, that is 
            <me>
                \emptyset=\{\}
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As there are no elements in <m>\emptyset</m>, therefore <m>|\emptyset|=0</m>, as well, to the the disjoy of all combinatorist, the statement <m>x\in\emptyset</m> is a contradiction (that is always false).

<title>Set Builder Notation</title>
<idx><h>set builder notation</h></idx>
  <p>
    Membership is the defining characteristic of a set, thus it is helpful to define a set by conditions for membership. One way to do that we call <term>set-builder notation</term>.
  </p>
  <image source="/images/set-build-p.jpeg" width="100%"/>
  <p>
    This is our way of defining membership <m>a\in\{x\text{ }|\text{ }P(x)\}</m> if and only if <m>P(a)</m> is true.
  </p>
  <example xml:id="ex-set-builder">
    <p>
        We include some sets defined with set-builder notation.
        <ol marker="(A)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>
                        \{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }-5\lt x\lt 5\}
                    </m>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>\{y\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }y=3a+1 \text{ for some }a\in\Z\}</m>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <m>\{z\in\Q\text{ }|\text{ }|z|\lt\sqrt{7}\}</m>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
    </p>
  </example>

    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex-set-builder"/> (B) we defined the condition with a quantifier, specifically <m>\exists a\in\Z</m>. This is an extremely common use-case in mathematics. I bring this up here to <m>{\color{red}{\text{warn}}}</m> the student that this is perhaps the most common quantifier to be <em>hidden</em>. That is, we would most likely see it presented as:
      <me>
        \{y\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }y=3a+1,\text{ }a\in\Z\}
      </me>
      To defend the mathematician which chooses to present it in this manner, we mostly study objects with a well defined and unique multiplication, that is there is only one unique integer <m>a</m> that satisfies <m>y=3a+1</m> for a given <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding to the possible confusion yet important to understand, for this <em>same</em> set it is true that 
      <me>
        \forall k\in\Z\text{ }(3k+1)\in\{y\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }y=3a+1,\text{ }a\in\Z\}
      </me>
      that is, by defining a set with an existential condition we are actually defining a universal relationship. To top it off we often do not even mention the universal relationship and <em>hide</em> the existential one, all in the sake of brevity and the word <em>obvious</em>.

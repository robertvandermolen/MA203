<title>In the Beggining We Had Shapes</title>
<introduction>
<p>
    As was true in ancient Athens, seems to ring true still in our sacred halls of academia, even more true after Bourbaki 
    came in with their wrecking ball, and that is: 
</p>
<p>
    ΑΓΕΩΜΕΤΡΗΤΟΣ ΜΗΔΕΙΣ ΕΙΣΙΤΩ
</p>

<p>
    Of course if that was "all greek to you" do not fret fair Ceasar, that was simply the author paying tribute to those 
    that came before... 
</p>
<p>
    The history of math books are littered with reference to tax collectors and assesors, but besides the lousey 
    adjectives that we call numbers we have had <alert>Geometry!</alert>

    <title>Undefined Terms</title>
    
    


<p>
    It is our intention to be able to agree, beyond a shadow of doubt, on the truth of a litany of statments. These agreements are called proofs.
     As one first ventures on this journey they often take many things for granted, perhaps the most important is that we have 
     a mutual agreemnt/understanding of the words and symbols being used in the discourse. This is easier said than done, as 
     when one is defining a word they must of course use <em>more words</em>, then those words would of course need 
    even more <em>words</em> to define them... and so on.... and so forth.  
</p>
<p>
    When would this pattern end? To ever have a discussion that went foward we would
    eventually need to stop. The <em>stopping</em> words, are commonly referred to
    as <alert>undefined terms</alert>. 
    
    For example, the almost universally agreed upon undefined terms for geometry are: <term>point</term>, <term>line</term>,
    and <term>incident</term>. 
</p>

<historical>
    <p>
Surprisingly, as Aristotle had already explained the necessity of undefined terms, Euclid did attempt to define the words such as point and line. 
Luckily this did not effect his discourse as the defintions were vague and used at best to visualize a gemoetry rather than fix them with an 
immutable meaning.

<section xml:id="subsec-1-1-2-axioms" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
    <title>Axioms</title>
<p>
After we have all agreed on the undefined terms we would then need to set some <em>ground rules</em>. These rules
that our new undefined terms must follow are known as <term>axioms</term>. Using our geometry example from above, one
common axiom of euclidean geometry is:
</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                For any two points there exists a line incident to both.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    the etymology of the word axiom comes a greek word meaning to require. I find this apropos as axioms are
    required otherwise we would have no footing to begin a discourse.

    <title>Defintions</title>
    <p>
        Now once we have our undefined terms, and axioms we begin building perhaps the most important part of 
        all proofs, the <term>defintions</term>. It is one of the <alert>major take-aways</alert> from this
        course that I would like the student to understand the importance of a definition. You can only prove something
        is true when you know that thing, when you know that thing's definition.

    <title>Proofs</title>
    <p>
        There are two interpretations of what has been presented before you. One, hopefully how it has been presented
        here, is that of there is no other way one could argue/debate without this structure. Otherwise, a party could
        simply keep going backwards and backwards with no assumptions/axioms to back stop the debate. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The other point of view, perhaps most popular in textbooks, is to call this approach <term>deductive reasoning</term>,
        and draw contrast to that of <term>inductive reasoning</term>. Some how pitting the two against each other. 
        The epitome of physicists versus mathematicians. Even, applied mathematicians vs theoretical mathematicians. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The differences attempting to be drawn between the world we have just set foward and that of collecting data 
        and observing specific 
        instances or phenomena, striving to form a theory, <alert>a model</alert>, that reveals patterns or 
        relationships among quantities and structures in nature. This process labeled as inductive reasoning, drawing 
        general conclusions from particular cases/patterns. Which is supposed to be in stark oppostion to deductive reasoning, 
        where we draw conclusions based on statements accepted as true, our axioms and undefined terms. After which proofs are built, to
        ensure that conclusions are drawn logically to arrive at truth. Yet, it is impossible to seperate these. It is the phenomena
        of our surrounding universe that Euclid yearned to define and describe in his geometries. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, do not take these abstractions as something to be taken for granted. To quote Russell, 
        "It is only at a high stage of cvilisation that we could take this series as a starting point". Or perhaps to quote another, 
        "undoubtly it took a million years to get the taste of an oyster just right".
    </p>
    <p>
        In this class we will not explore the amzaing world of tracing back every single conclusion to an undefined term 
        or axiom, but instead we will start with A LOT of assumptions, assumptions students at this stage are used to making, namely 
        "college algebra". Then later we will use less and less assumptions, only dipping our toe in the <em>endless</em> pond of abstraction.

<title>Conditionals and Biconditionals</title>

<p>
    In the last section we saw a few connectives. 
    Using only these connectives is possible and 
    is all you need for a <term>complete</term>
    logical system, but it ignores an important 
    decree used quite often in 
    logic/debate/mathematics. That is the 
    implilcation.

<definition>
    <p>Given a propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,</p>
    <statement>
        <p>
            the <term>conditional statment</term>
            <m>P\implies Q</m> is the propostion
        </p>
        <p>
            "If <m>P</m> then <m>Q</m>"
        </p>
        <p>
            Propostion <m>P</m> is called the <term>antecedent</term>
            and <m>Q</m> is the <term>consequent</term>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The conditional statement <m>P\implies Q</m>
            is true exactly when <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m>
            is true. 
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>There are many ways of translating the conditional
    to english statments, which we will in the next table
    but perhaps the most popular is <term>implies</term>,
    that is "<m>P</m> implies <m>Q</m>".

    I have found the truth values of this connective to be the most challenging for students. To help I suggest the student always think
    of the next example.
</p>
<p>
    <example xml:id="ex-lying">
        <title>The Lying Politician</title>
        <p>
            <m>P</m>: If I am elected
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>Q</m>: I will lower taxes
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>P\implies Q</m>: If I am elected then I will lower taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when is politician lying?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a couple of cases: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The politiciian is indeed elected:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician lowers taxes!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politiciian is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician does not lower taxes
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politiciain is lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The politician is not elected:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician works hard with community leaders and lobbies to get taxes lowered
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politician is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician sits on their couch all day eating Fruit Loops, and taxes are not lowered
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politician is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </example>
</p>
<p>
    Students seem to have the hardes time seeing that when the politician is not elected their is no obligation to do anything and hence 
    the politician is not lying!

    <p>
        Instead of writting "if and only if" we will often
        elect to only type <alert>"iff"</alert>. Just as with the implication, the biconditional has many english translations:

    <p>
        It is this biconditional that I believe many students hear when they hear the phrase: "If I am elected then I will lower taxes". 
        When indeed they mean "Taxes will be lowered if, but only if I am elected".

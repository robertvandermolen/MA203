<title>Propositions and Connectives</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        I have heard many students say things like "I'm a math major not an English major".
        This sentiment becomes further and further from the truth as you continue your journey in 
        the major of mathematics. For one, you begin to see mathematics as a language itself with 
        its own grammar and rules, and in particular in this course you begin to only write paragraphs
        in exchange for the string of symbols and numbers from your calculus courses. As we begin our journey into 
        abstract mathematics we need to do the exact opposite of this sentiment, and instead examine 
        how language works, specifically how language handles truth.</p>
        <p>
        In English, as in many languages, there are many types of sentences, some more complicated than others. We will
        now be concerning ourselves with if a sentence is true. This is the hallmark of proving, by only writing sentences
        that are true, so that our conclusions are then true.  
    </p>

    <title>Propositions and Negation</title>
    
    <p>
        Even though many statements/sentences can be true or can be false, it doesn't make sense to say that any sentence 
        that you could write is true or not. For example a <em>question</em> 
        such as <em>"Where is my phone?"</em> or an <em>exclamation</em> like <em>"Oh No!"</em>. Both of these examples are 
        indeed complete sentences, as in they express a complete thought, but are neither true nor false.
    </p>
<definition>
    <title>Proposition</title>
    
<idx>proposition</idx>
<p>A <term>proposition</term> is a sentence that can take only one of two values: truth or false. 
    </p>
</definition>
<p>
    <example xml:id="prop-example">
        <title>Some Examples of Propostions</title>
        <idx>proposition</idx>
        <p>The following are examples of propositions:</p>
        <ol marker="(A)">
            <li><m>2+5=4</m></li>
            <li>The gazel will become the only living animal on earth by the year 2525.</li>
            <li>Galileo Galilei had bacon on his eleventh birthday.</li>
        </ol>
    </example></p>
   <p>
    Some propositions, like (A) in <xref ref="prop-example"/> have clear truth values, that is we can easily
    determine if the statement is either True or False (but not both). Perhaps, to untangle the last sentence, it
    is clear that (A) in <xref ref="prop-example"/> is False.    
    </p>
    <p>
        Yet, the remaining (B) and (C) in <xref ref="prop-example"/>, cannot be easily determined if they are True or False
            (unless of course you are reading this after 2525) but nonetheless they are either True or False (and not both)
            whether or not we can determine which one.
    </p>
    <p>
            <example xml:id="not-prop-example">
                <title>Some Examples of Sentences that are not Propositions</title>
                
                
       <p> The following are sentences that are NOT propositions:</p>
       <ol marker="(A)">
        <li>Stop!</li>    
        <li>She has my phone.</li>
            <li><m>x+2=4</m></li>
            <li>This sentence is false.</li>
            </ol>
    </example>
</p>
<p>
    <idx><h>paradox</h></idx>
  For examples (B) and (C) in <xref ref="not-prop-example"/> are not propositions because (B) depends on who "She" is to
  determine its truth value, while in (C) it depends on what "<m>x</m>" is, for example when <m>x</m> is 2 it is True, but when <m>x</m> 
  is 3 it is False. Example (A) from <xref ref="not-prop-example"/> is an exclamation and is neither True nor False. Finally, (D) from 
  <xref ref="not-prop-example"/> is known as a <term>paradox</term>. If the statement “This sentence is false” is true,
  then by its meaning it must be false. On the other hand, if the given statement is false, then what it claims is false, 
  so it must be true.
</p>

<p>
    In our journey of learning propositional logic we will often find it necessary to discuss arbitrary propositions.
    To do so we will try and use capital letters such as: <m>P</m>, <m>Q</m>, <m>R</m>, <m>S</m>, and <m>T</m>. 
</p>

<p>
    There are many ways to create new propositions from old ones. Our first tool to do just that is the logical <term>negation</term>.

    <p>Given a proposition <m>P</m>,</p>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>negation</term> of <m>P</m>, denoted <m>\sim P</m>, is the proposition
        </p>
        <p>
            "<alert>not</alert> <m>P</m>"
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\sim P</m> is true exactly when <m>P</m> is false.
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
</p>

<p>
    It is noteworthy that the symbol <m>\neg</m> can be found in many texts for the negation as well. The negation
    is simply the opposite of the proposition.

    In <xref ref="prop-example" /> the propositions are all <term>simple</term> or <term>atomic</term> in the sense
    that they do not have any other propositions as components. <term>Compound</term> propositions can be formed by using connective words, 
    connecting more than one proposition.

    <p>Given propositions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,</p>
    <statement>
        <p>
        The <term>conjunction</term> of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, denoted <m>P\wedge Q</m>,
        is the proposition:

</definition>
<p>We will see throughout this course that many different words in English can be used for our propositions
    with the same meaning. For example, but, while, and although are usually translated symbolically
    with the conjunction connective. An example of this, using the propositions 
    from (A) in <xref ref="ex-conjunction"/>, is we could 
    write "It is not raining outside but I do  have my umbrella" symbolically as "<m>(\sim P)\wedge Q</m>".

<statement>
    <p>The <term>disjunction</term> of <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, denoted <m>P\vee Q</m>, 
        is the proposition:</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>inclusive or</h></idx>
    <idx><h>exclusive or</h></idx>
    The logical disjunction is often referred to as the <term>inclusive or</term>, as it is still true when both
    propositions are true. In English we often assume the use of the <term>exclusive or</term>, that is, when we use
    the word <em>or</em> we most often mean only one of two choices. For example "would you like chicken or steak". When someone says this to you, you know 
    immediately they do not mean that you can have both chicken and steak, that is not the case for the logical 
    disjunction.

  <title>New Relations From Old</title>

  
    <p>
        This subsection is dedicated to making new relations from old ones. Our first method is by <em>turning around</em> the arrows.

                If <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, then the inverse of <m>R</m> is the relation

            We will consider the same sets and relation as in <xref ref="ex-dom"/>. The inverse is thus

        <statement>
            <p>
               Let <m>R</m> be a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, and let <m>S</m> be a relation from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>.
               The composite of <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> is <me>S\circ R = \{(a,c)\text{ } |\text{ } \exists b \in B \text{ such that } (a,b)\in R \text{ and } (b,c) \in S\}</me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
        <p>
            For this example consider again the sets
            <me>
                A=\{1,2,3,4,5\}

                B=\{a,b,c,d,e\}

            but in addition consider the set
        </p>
        <image source="/images/the_c.jpeg" width="62%"/>
        <p>
            and define the relation <m>R</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> as

                R=\{(1,c),(2,a),(3,e),(4,a),(4,d)\}

            and define the relation <m>S</m> from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m> as

             <image source="/images/s_relation.jpeg" width="62%"/>
        <p>
            Thus we can visulaize the composition as

        <image source="/images/s_circ_r.jpeg" width="100%"/>
        <p>
            and the relation is thus defined as

        <image source="/images/s_circ_r_def.jpeg" width="62%"/>
        <p>
            Notice we have the following domain and range of the composition

                \text{Dom}(S\circ R)=\{1,2,3,4\}

        </p>
        <image source="/images/rng_s_circ_r.jpeg" width="62%"/>
    </example>

  
  <p>
    Lets explore a few examples proving using this new concept of composition.
  </p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider <m>N</m> and <m>S</m>, relations on <m>\Z</m>, defined as follows:
        <me>
            N=\{(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z\text{ }|\text{ }9|(a-b)\}
        </me>
         <me>
            S=\{(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z\text{ }|\text{ }6|(a-b)\}
         </me>
         <alert>Prove:</alert> <m>N\circ S\subseteq\{(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z\text{ }|\text{ }3|(a-b)\}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        <proof>
            <p>
               As one must do, we assume what we need to assume, namely assume that <m>N</m> and <m>S</m> are relations on <m>\Z</m> defined above.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, choose an arbitrary element <m>x\in N\circ S</m>, since <m>N</m> and <m>S</m> are relations on <m>\Z</m> by definition of composite we can find an <m>a\in\Z</m> and a <m>b\in\Z</m> such that <m>x=(a,b)</m>, such that we can find an integer <m>f</m> such that <m>6|(a-f)</m> and <m>9|(f-b)</m>. By definition of divides we can find an <m>s\in\Z</m> and <m>t\in\Z</m> such that <m>a-f=6s</m> and <m>f-b=9t</m>. Calculate
                <md>
                    <mrow>a-b=(a-f)+(f-b) \amp= 6s+9t </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp=3(2s+3t) </mrow>
                </md>
                and since <m>2s+3t</m> is an integer by the definition of divides we can conclude that <m>3|(a-b)</m>, and thus <m>(a,b)\in\{(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z\text{ }|\text{ }3|(a-b)\}</m> as desired.
            </p>

            We will prove part (b) and leave the rest as exercises for the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose that <m>A, B, C, \text{ and } D</m> are sets. Let <m>R</m> be a relation from
            <m>A \text{ to } B</m>, <m>S</m> be a relation from <m>B \text{ to } C</m>, and <m>T</m>
            be a relation from <m>C\text { to } D</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we are proving an equality, we will have to prove both subsets. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }T\circ(S\circ R)\subseteq (T\circ S)\circ R}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let <m>a\in T\circ (S\circ R)</m>, by definition of composition, <m>T\circ(S\circ R)</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>D</m>, hence by the definition of relation we can find an <m>x\in A</m> and a <m>y\in B</m> such that <m>a=(x,y)</m>.  Now, as well by definition of composition, <m>S\circ R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>C</m>, and since <m>T</m> is a relation from <m>C</m> to <m>D</m>, we can find a <m>z\in C</m> such that <m>(z,y)\in T</m>
            and <m>(x,z)\in (S\circ R)</m>. Again, by the definition of composition, since <m>S</m> is a relation from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m> and <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> we can find <m>w\in B</m> such that 
            <m>(x,w)\in R</m> and <m>(w,z)\in S</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since <m>(z,y)\in T</m>, and <m>(w,z)\in S</m> then by definition of composite we have that <m>(w,y)\in (T\circ S)</m>. And since <m>(x,w)\in R</m> and <m>(w,y)\in(T\circ S)</m> then by definition of composite we can conclude that <m>(x,y)\in (T\circ S)\circ R</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }T\circ(S\circ R)\supseteq (T\circ S)\circ R}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
            For this part, we choose an arbitrary element <m>b\in(T\circ S)\circ R</m>. Again, by definition of composition <m>T\circ S</m> is a relation from <m>B</m> to <m>D</m> and since <m>R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m>, hence <m>(T\circ S)\circ R</m> is a relation from <m>A</m> to <m>D</m>, hence we can find a <m>s\in A</m> and a <m>t\in D</m> such that <m>b=(s,t)</m>. As well, by the definition of composite we can find <m>u\in B</m> such that <m>(s,u)\in R</m> and <m>(u,t)\in T\circ S</m>. Yet, by definition if composite since <m>T</m> is a relation from <m>C</m> to <m>D</m> and <m>S</m> is a relation from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m> we can find <m>i\in C</m> such that <m>(u,i)\in S</m> and <m>(i,t)\in T</m>. Thus, because <m>(s,u)\in R</m> and <m>(u,i)\in S</m> by definition of composite <m>(s,i)\in S\circ R</m>. In a similar fashion as we also have <m>(i,t)\in T</m> we can conclude that <m>(s,t)\in T\circ (S\circ R)</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we have shown that both <m>T\circ(S\circ R)\subseteq (T\circ S)\circ R</m> and <m>T\circ(S\circ R)\supseteq (T\circ S)\circ R</m> we can conclude that <m>T\circ(S\circ R)= (T\circ S)\circ R</m>.

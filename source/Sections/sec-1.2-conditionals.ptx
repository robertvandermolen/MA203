    In the last section we saw a few connectives. 
    Using only these connectives is possible and 
    is all you need for a <term>complete</term>
    logical system, but it ignores an important 
    decree used quite often in 
    logic/debate/mathematics. That is the 
    implilcation.

            Propostion <m>P</m> is called the <term>antecedent</term>

        </p>
        <p>
            The conditional statement <m>P\implies Q</m>
            is true exactly when <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m>
            is true.

    There are many ways of translating the conditional
    to english statments, which we will in the next table
    but perhaps the most popular is <term>implies</term>,
    that is "<m>P</m> implies <m>Q</m>".

    I have found the truth values of this connective to be the most challenging for students. To help I suggest the student always think
    of the next example.
</p>
<p>
    <example xml:id="ex-lying">
        <title>The Lying Politician</title>
        <idx><h>implies</h></idx>
        <idx><h>conditional</h></idx>
        <idx><h>lying politician</h></idx>
        <p>
            <m>P</m>: If I am elected
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>Q</m>: I will lower taxes
        </p>
        <p>
            <m>P\implies Q</m>: If I am elected then I will lower taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when is politician lying?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a couple of cases: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The politiciian is indeed elected:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician lowers taxes!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politiciian is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician does not lower taxes
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politiciain is lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The politician is not elected:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician works hard with community leaders and lobbies to get taxes lowered
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politician is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The politician sits on their couch all day eating Fruit Loops, and taxes are not lowered
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The politician is not lying!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </example>
</p>
<p>
    Students seem to have the hardes time seeing that when the politician is not elected their is no obligation to do anything and hence 
    the politician is not lying!

        It is this biconditional that I believe many students hear when they hear the phrase: "If I am elected then I will lower taxes". 
        When indeed they mean "Taxes will be lowered if, but only if I am elected".

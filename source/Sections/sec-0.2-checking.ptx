<title>Just Check a Bunch</title>

    Students are probably most familiar with the natural and social sciences, where theories are tested by comparing what 
    happens in experiments to what was predicted, and checking that the results stay the same when the experiment is repeated. 
    In math, often, the goal is to figure out whether a statement is always true. Even if a statement works for a lot of 
    examples, there's still the chance that one example we haven't tested could show it's false. For example, 
    you might notice that the expression
</p>

    <p>
        This example is inspired by an example that I absolutely fell in love with. I first 
        came across the inspirational example in
        Smith, Douglas, Maurice Eggen, and Richard St Andre. "A transition to advanced mathematics." (1983).
    </p>
</historical>
<p> 
<me>x^2-7x+53</me>
</p>
<p>
produces a prime number for <em>many</em> values of <m>x</m>. The diligent student will check that for the first 10, 20, 30 
or even 40 positive integers when we substitute our number for <m>x</m> we arrive at a prime number such as
</p>
<p>
    <me>(4)^2-7(4)+53=41</me>
</p>
<p> 
which is prime! If this hard working student were to check with other numbers like 41, 42, and 43 they would also
discover prime numbers as the solution. 
</p>
<p>
However, this is not a conclusive proof, as it fails for <m>x = 44</m>, where the result is 1681, 
which is actually a square, that is it factors as <m>41\times 41</m>. </p>
<p>I know for almost all of you, at least at one time in your life, it is enticing to just try specific examples. 
    As well, it is undeniable that exploring these examples can, at times, offer valuable insights into 
mathematical concepts and relationships, it is not sufficient as a proof unless every possible case can be examined.

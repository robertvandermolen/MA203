    Consider the set <m>A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}</m>, and the family <m>C = \{C_1, C_2, C_3\}</m> where <m>C_1 = \{b,e\}</m>,
    <m>C_2 = \{a,c,d\}</m>, and <m>C_3 = \{b,e\}</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    It passes all three tests, so the family <m>C</m> is a partition of <m>A</m>, even thought the sets <m>C_1</m>
    and <m>C_3</m> are not disjoint. **SAY MORE!!**

    The family <m>\{C_1, C_2, C_3\}</m> is the same as the family <m>\{C_2, C_3, C_1\}</m>.

        Let <m>\mathscr{P}</m> be a partition of the nonempty set <m>A</m>. For <m>x</m> and <m>y\in A</m> define <m>xQy</m> if and
        only if there exists <m>C\in \mathscr{P}</m> such that <m>x\in C</m> and <m>y\in C</m>. Then <m>Q</m> is an equivalence
        relation on <m>A</m>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      <alert>[Reflexive]</alert>
    </p>
    <p>
      let <m>x\in A</m>. Since <m>\mathscr{P}</m> is a partition, <m>x\in \cup X = A</m>. Hence we can find a <m>C \in \mathscr{P}</m>

      such that <m>x\in C_1</m> and <m>y\in C_1</m>, and <m>y\in C_2</m> and <m>z\in C_2</m>. Hence, <m>y\in C_1 \cap C_2</m>.
      Hence <m>C_1\cap C_2 \neq \emptyset</m>. Hence by definition of partition, <m>C_1=C_2</m>. Hence <m>x\in C</m>
      and <m>z\in C</m>. Hence by definition of <m>Q, (x,z) \in Q</m>.

    <alert>Prove:</alert> If <m>f: A \rightarrow B</m> is one-to-one and <m>g: B \rightarrow C</m> is one-to-one, then 
    <m>g\circ f</m> is one-to-one.
  </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>f: A \hookrightarrow B</m> and <m>g: B \hookrightarrow C</m>. Let <m>(x,y)\in A</m> such that 
      <m>g\circ f(x) = g\circ f(y)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By definition of composition we can find <m>z\in B</m> such that <m>f(x) = z</m> and <m>g(z) = g\circ f(x)</m>.
      Also by definition of composition, we can find <m>w\in B</m> such that <m>f(y) = w</m> and <m>g(w) = g\circ f(y)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By assumption that <m>g\circ f(x) = g\circ f(y), g(w) = g(z)</m>. By our assumption that <m>g</m> is one-to-one, <m>w=z</m>.
      Since <m>w=z, f(x)=f(y)</m>. Thus, by our assumption that <m>f</m> is one-to-one, <m>x=y</m>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume <m>f</m> is a bijection from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> and <m>g</m> is a bijection from <m>B</m> to <m>C</m>.

      and <m>f(x) = z</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By our assumption that <m>g(w) = g(z)</m>, as <m>g</m> is a bijection, in particular one-to-one, <m>w=z</m>. Hence 
      <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is a bijection, in particular one-to-one, <m>x=y</m>.

      such that <m>g(w) = y</m>.

    <p>
      Thus by assumption that <m>f</m> is a bijection, specifically surjective, we can find <m>x\in A</m> such that <m>f(x) = w</m>.
      Thus by definition of composition, <m>g\circ f(x) =  y</m>. Hence, <m>y\in \text{ Rng}(g\circ f)</m>. Thus
      <m>C \subset \text{ Rng}(g\circ f)</m>.

    <p>
      Thus, Rng<m>(g\circ f) = C</m>

    <p>
      Thus, <m>g\circ f: A \rightarrow C</m> is a bijection.

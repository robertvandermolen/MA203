<title>Comparing and Combining Sets</title>
<p>
    Now we will begin comparing sets. Our first tool of comparison is the concept of subset.
</p>
<definition xml:id="defn-subset">
    <title>Subset</title>
    <idx><h>subset</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>subset</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
           We say that the set <m>A</m> is a <term>subset</term> of a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\subseteq B</m>, if and only if for all <m>x\in\mathcal{U}</m>, <me>x \in A \implies x \in B</me>
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    To say that in more plain language, <m>A\subseteq B</m> means <m>B</m> contains all the elements of <m>A</m>, it is noteworthy that <m>B</m> may contain more than just those elements from <m>A</m>.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="72.5%"/>
    <image source="/images/set_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        notice that every element from <m>A</m> can also be found in <m>B</m>, that is <m>A\subseteq B</m>.
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{3, 6, 9, 12, 15\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=3a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Notice that <m>A\subseteq B</m> since 
        <md>
            <mrow>3 =\amp 3\cdot 1</mrow>
            <mrow>6 =\amp 3\cdot 2 </mrow>
            <mrow>9 =\amp 3\cdot 3</mrow>
            <mrow>12 =\amp 3\cdot 4 </mrow>
            <mrow>15 =\amp 3\cdot 5 </mrow>
        </md>
        that is, every element of <m>A</m> is also an element of <m>B</m>.
    </p>
    
</example>
<p>
    When a set <m>A</m> has exactly the same elements of a set <m>B</m> we say those set are equal. The following definition makes this more rigours 
</p>
<definition xml:id="defn-equals">
    <title>Equal Sets</title>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>equal</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
           We say that a set <m>A</m> is <term>equal</term> to a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A= B</m>, if and only if  both <me>A\subseteq B</me> and <me>B\subseteq A</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            or equivalently by:
            <me>
                \forall x\in\mathcal{U}\text{ }x\in A \iff x\in B
            </me>
            
        </p>
    </statement>
</definition>
<p>
    Sets are equal exactly when you would think they are, when they are the same set. Yet, as hopefully you have been piecing together in this journey, to prove things like "they are the same" we need a bit more rigor and propositional <em>guidance</em> to prove truth. Shortly we will venture into the world of proving with these sets, yet lets take a little time not just to build a rigorous definitions but to build our intuition further. 
</p>
<p>
    We now venture into combining sets, that is making new sets given one or more sets. 
</p>
<definition xml:id="def-union">
    <title>Union</title>
    <idx><h>union</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>union</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            We define the <term>union</term> of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cup B</m> as the set:
        </p>
        <p><me>A \cup B = \{x\text{ } |\text{ } x \in A \vee x \in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>As is done for a set, we must define what it takes for membership to this set. For the union membership is allowed when membership of either <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is established.
    In more common vernacular, this says that the union of two sets is anything from either set.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the following sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/first_set.jpeg" width="65%"/>
    <image source="/images/new_b.jpeg" width="62%"/>
    <p>
        then the union of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is as follows
    </p>
    <image source="/images/union.jpeg" width="100%"/>
  </example>
  <example>
   <p>
    Define the sets 
    <me>
        A=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }0\leq x\lt10\}
    </me>
    <me>
        B=\{x\in\R\text{ }|\text{ }-10\lt x\lt 0\}
    </me>
    Thus the union of these two sets is
    <me>
        A\cup B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }-10\lt x\lt 10\}
    </me>
    since any real number between -10 and 10 are either included between 0 and 10 or between -10 and 0.
   </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    Another way to combine sets is to only consider the elements in which they share, this is our next definition.
  </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-intersection">
    <title>Intersection</title>
    <idx><h>intersection</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>intersection</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>intersection</term> of two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A\cap B</m>, is defined as
        </p>
        <p><me>A \cap B = \{x \text{ }|\text{ } x \in A \wedge x \in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>Again, as these are sets, we must define what it means to be a member of this set. For the intersection membership is defined for those elements that have membership to both the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. Or in other words, the intersection only has the things that are shared between two sets.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the following sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersect_a.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <image source="/images/intersect_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        therefore the intersection of these two sets are
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersection.jpeg" width="96%"/>
    <p>
        Notice that elements in the intersection are exactly those that show up in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }0\lt x\leq 10\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Thus the intersection of these two sets is
        <me>
            A\cap B=\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}
        </me>
        since those are the only even integers between 0 and 10 (including 10).
       </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    The last construction showed where two sets were the same yet, now we explore where they differ.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-set-difference">
    <title>Difference</title>
    <idx><h>difference</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>difference</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>difference</term> of a set <m>A</m> and a set <m>B</m>, denoted <m>A-B</m>, is the set defined as
        </p>
        <p><me>A-B = \{x \text{ }|\text{ } x \in A \wedge x \not\in B\}</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>The difference of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> consists of the things that are in <m>A</m>, but not in <m>B</m>.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        Consider the sets
    </p>
    <image source="/images/intersect_a.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <image source="/images/intersect_b.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
        thus the set difference of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> is
    </p>
    <image source="/images/difference.jpeg" width="68%"/>
    <p>
        notice that the difference is made up only of elements that appear in <m>A</m> yet do not appear in <m>B</m>.
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
        Define the sets 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }0\lt x\lt 10\}
        </me>
        <me>
            B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Thus the difference of these two sets is
        <me>
            A- B=\{1,3,5,7,9\}
        </me>
        since these are there integers between 0 and 10 that are not even.
       </p>
  </example>
  <p>
    To end this section we have been quite flipant on our universe of discourse, yet with a well defined one we can look at the set difference involving the universe.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def-compliment">
    <title>Compliment</title>
    <idx><h>compliment</h></idx>
    <idx><h>set</h><h>compliment</h></idx>
    <statement>
        <p>
            The <term>compliment</term> of a set <m>A</m> in the universe <m>\mathcal{U}</m>, is defined as the following set,
        </p>
        <p><me>A^c = \{x \in \mathcal{U} \text{ }|\text{ } x \not\in A\}</me> or <me>A^c = \mathcal{U}-A</me></p>
    </statement>   
  </definition>
  <p>The compliment can, perhaps, most simply be stated as everything that is not in <m>A</m>.</p>
  <example>
    <p>
        For this example consider the universe of discord as the intergers, <m>\mathcal{U}=\Z</m>, and consider the set of all even numbers, that is the set 
        <me>
            A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        Then the compliment of <m>A</m> is all the integers that are not even, or in-lieu of <xref ref="lem-odd-not-even"/> we have that 
        <me>
            A^c=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2y+1\text{ for some }y\in\Z\}
        </me>
        
    </p>
  </example>

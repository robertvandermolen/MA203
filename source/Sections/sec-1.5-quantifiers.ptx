  <title>Quantifiers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is now time to take care of those statments that were not propositons from <xref ref="not-prop-example"/>, but have 
      propably been bugging you this whole time like: <m>x+2=4</m>, which are known as an <term>open statment</term> or 
      <term>predicate</term>. But, how on earth are we to do mathematics and these sentences 
      not be in our lexicon? To handle these we need to quantify the <m>x</m>, by saying we can find a number so that 
      <m>x+2=4</m>. Before quantifying the statement you didn't even need to assume <m>x</m> was a number! 
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Dr. Rob I could tell <m>x</m> was a number by context!" 
    </p>
    <p>
      But, what context was that? Was it that this is a math class and I'm a math professor? Even so, what kind of number? A 
      rational number (fractions)? A positive number? An imaginary number?

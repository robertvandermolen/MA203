  <title>Functions</title>
  <p>
    Functions are important no matter the field you go into, and you have had a lot of experience with functions up to this point. Let's now formalize the definition of function as a specific type of relation.
  </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>function</term>, or <term>mapping</term>, from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> is a relation <m>f</m> from <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> such that:
      </p>
      <ol marker="(i)">
        <li>
          <p>
            The domain of <m>f</m> is <m>A</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>(x,y)\in f</m> and <m>(x,z)\in f</m> then <m>y=z</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For a function <m>f</m> we write <me>f: A \rightarrow B</me> We <em>say</em> 
        <me>\text{"}f \text{ is a function from } A \text{ to } B\text{"}</me>
        or 
        <me>\text{"}f \text{ maps }A\text{ to }B\text{"}</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The set <m>B</m> is called the <term>codomain</term> of <m>f</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case where <m>B=A</m>, we say that 
       <me>f\text{ is a function on }A\text{"}</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        When <m>(x,y)\in f</m>, we write <m>y=f(x)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    At first glance condition (ii) may look foreign to you, yet in your calculus and college algebra classes you probably just called this the vertical line test, seen in this next example.
  </p>
  <example>
    <p>
      We saw that <em>equals</em> was a relation at the beginning of this chapter in <xref ref="ex-equals"/>, indeed it is also a function. To use it in the our new context of functions, define the function
      <me>
        f:\R\rightarrow\R
      </me>
      as 
      <me>
        f(x)=x
      </me>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/horz_test.jpeg" width="75%"/>
    <p>
      Notice that where we choose to draw a vertical line is the choice of an element of the domain of <m>f</m>, i.e. an element of <m>\R</m>, and the condition that the vertical line only hits the graph once is the condition the f(x) has only one output, as is condition (ii) of being a function. 
    </p>
  </example>
  <example>
    <p>
      Notice that the <em>eats</em> relation from <xref ref="ex-eats"/> is not a function as both
    </p>
    <image source="/images/turt_leaf.jpeg" width="39%"/>
    <p>
    and
    </p>
    <image source="/images/turt_pizza.jpeg" width="39%"/>
    <p>
      So lets consider a slightly different relation, by putting the turtle on a diet,
      <me>
        D:Z\rightarrow F
      </me>
      defined as the following
    </p>
    <image source="/images/d.jpeg" width="100%"/>
    <p>
      Now it makes sense to use the <em>of</em> notation of functions because for example there is only one way to write the following:
    </p>
    <image source="/images/turt_of_leaf.jpeg" width="39%"/>
  </example>
  <example xml:id="ex-is-a-function">
    <p>
      Consider the relation <m>f</m> from <m>\Z\times\Z</m> to <m>\Z</m> defined as
      <me>
        f=\{((a,b),c)\in\Z\times\Z\times\Z\text{ }|\text{ }c=3a+2b\}
      </me>
      <alert>Prove:</alert> <m>f</m> is a function
    </p>
    <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          To prove that <m>f</m> is a function we need to show the two conditions of being a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Condition (i)</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first condition is an equality of sets, per usual we will split this into two parts
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Dom}(f)\subseteq\Z\times\Z}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>(a,b)\in\text{Dom}(f)</m> by definition of <m>f</m> we have that <m>(a,b)\in\Z\times\Z</m> as desired. (the room chants <em>obviously!</em>)
        </p>
        <p>
          <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }\text{Dom}(f)\supseteq\Z\times\Z}</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>(x,y)\in\Z\times\Z</m>, then <m>((x,y),3x+2y)\in f</m> by definition of <m>f</m>, as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have shown both <m>\text{Dom}(f)\subseteq\Z\times\Z</m> and <m>\text{Dom}(f)\supseteq\Z\times\Z</m> we can conclude <m>\text{Dom}(f)=\Z\times\Z</m>. Therefore we have shown that <m>f</m> satisfies condition (i) of being a function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <alert>Condition (ii)</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume <m>((n,m),c)\in f</m> and <m>((n,m),d)\in f</m>, hence by definition of <m>f</m> we have that <m>c=3n+2m</m> and that <m>m=3n+2m</m> hence <m>c=d</m> as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we have shown both conditions to be a function we can conclude that <m>f</m> is a function.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </p>
  </example>
<p>
  The jump from relations to functions can be jarring to students especially with all of the corresponding notations, we take a moment now and attempt to make sense of them.
</p>
 <assemblage>
    <title>Functions VS Relations</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be sets, and consider a function <m>f:A\rightarrow B</m>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      At the root a function is just a <em>relation</em> and hence <m>f\subseteq A\times B</m> 
      </p>
      <p>
      Instead of writing <me>(x,y)\in f</me> or <me>xfy</me> we  write <me>f(x)=y</me>, moreover we most often <alert>don't write</alert> the <m>y</m>, that is we have <me>x\in A \text{ and }f(x)\in B</me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put this context of relations once again (and hopefully not make it too much more convoluted) we have
      <me>
        (f,f(x))\in f
      </me>
      and perhaps the most labyrinthine interpretation where <m>f</m> represents the relation <m>f</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is the element of <m>B</m> related to <m>x</m> via <m>f</m>.
      <me>
        x\text{ }f\text{ }f(x)
      </me>
    </p>
  </assemblage>

    The next concepts come up over and over again in algebra, analysis and topology.

    Let's end this section with a couple more examples of proofs involving these new concepts.
  </p>
 
<example>
  <p>
    Let <m>f:A\rightarrow B, D\subseteq A</m> and <m>E\subseteq B</m>
  </p> 
  <p>
  <alert>Prove: <m>f(f^{-1}(E))\subseteq E</m></alert>
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
    Let <m>x\in f(f^{-1}(E))</m>. By the definition of image, we can find <m>y\in f^{-1}(E)</m> such that <m>f(y)=x</m>. By definition of inverse image, 
    <m>f(y)\in E</m>. Thus, since <m>f(y) = x</m> we have that <m>x\in E</m>, therefore <m>f(f^{-1}(E))\subseteq E</m>. 
    </p>
  </proof>
</example>
<example>
  <p>
    Let <m>f: A\rightarrow B</m>, and let <m>X\subseteq A</m>,  <m>Y \subseteq A</m>, <m>U\subseteq B</m>, and <m>V \subseteq B</m>.

  <p>
  <alert>Prove: <m>f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(U-V)</m></alert>.
  </p>
  <proof>
    <p>
      As this is a proof of equality of sets we should break the proof into two pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)\subseteq f^{-1}(U-V)}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>x\in f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)</m>. By defintion of difference, <m>x\in f^{-1}(U)</m> and <m>x \not\in f^{-1}(V)</m>. By definition of inverse image,
      <m>f(x)\in U</m> and <m>f(x)\not\in V</m>. By definition of difference, <m>f(x)\in U-V</m>. Thus, by definition of inverse image, <m>x\in f^{-1}(U-V)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\mathbf{\text{Proof of }f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)\supseteq f^{-1}(U-V)}</m>

      Let <m>y\in f^{-1}(U-V)</m> by definition of inverse image <m>f(y)\in U-V</m>, by definition of difference <m>f(y)\in U</m> and <m>f(y)\not\in V</m> hence by definition of inverse image <m>y\in f^{-1}(U)</m> and <m>y\not\in f^{-1}(V)</m>, thus by definition of difference <m>y\in f^{-1}(U)-f^{-1}(V)</m>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since we have shown both <m>f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)\subseteq f^{-1}(U-V)</m> and <m>f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)\supseteq f^{-1}(U-V)</m> we can conclude <m>f^{-1}(U) - f^{-1}(V)=f^{-1}(U-V)</m>

<title>Venn Diagrams and Logic of Sets</title>
<idx><h>Venn diagram</h></idx>
<p>
    To understand/describe the relationship between sets we often use a tool known as <term>Venn Diagrams</term>. In simpliest terms a Venn diagram is a drawing representing the sets we are considering, we draw a circle for each set, and imagine the elements are inside the circle. Further, in this section we will use the basic underpinnning of propositional logic to pick apart some logical conclusions from set theory.

<historical>
    <p>
        John Venn was an English mathematician that in the 1800's introduced Eulerian Circles, which we now dawn with his name.

    <title>Venn Diagrams</title>
<p>
    We now provide some basic examples of Venn diagrams.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for a singular set <m>A</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/venn_A.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for <m>A\subseteq B</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="/images/subset-a.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<p>
    When we are indicating a specific portion of the Venn diagram we will use shading, such as the following examples.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for <m>A\cup B</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a-cup-b.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for <m>A\cap B</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a_cap_b.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for <m>A- B</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="/images/a-minus-b.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        A Venn diagram for <m>A^c</m> 
    </p>
    <image source="/images/not_a.jpeg" width="75%"/>
</example>
<p>
    In this chapter's exercises (<xref ref="sec-5-8-ch05-exercises"/>) you will be asked to identify different sets in a Venn diagram. To help the student still attempting to take a grasp of set theory we give a few more creative examples next.
</p>
<example>
    <p>
        The set: <m>(A-B)^c</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/not-a-b.jpeg" width="75%"/>
    <p>
        Here consider the set that contains <m>A</m> yet not that, that is in <m>B</m>, this is exactly the part that is not shaded, as it is the compliment.
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        The set: <m>(A\cup B)^c\cap C</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/not-a-cup-b.jpeg" width="75%"/>
    <p>
        This time we consider a the place which is neither <m>A</m> nor <m>B</m> yet is in <m>C</m>
    </p>
</example>
<example>
    <p>
        The set: <m>(A\cap C)^c\cup B</m>
    </p>
    <image source="/images/not-a-cap-c.jpeg" width="75%"/>
    <p>
        In this example consider the set that avoids where <m>A</m> intersects <m>C</m> yet does include all of <m>B</m>.
    </p>

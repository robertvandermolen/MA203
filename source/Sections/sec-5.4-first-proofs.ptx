<title>First Proofs with Sets</title>
<p>
    In the previous section we looked at many basic properties of sets. Now we will venture into some proofs that are more indicative of your future classes, and return (momentarily) back to the safety of numbers.
</p>
<p>
    We first examine how one would prove a subset to be true.
</p>
<assemblage>
    <title>Proving <m>A\subseteq B</m></title>
    <p>
      Let <m>x\in A</m>
    </p>
    <p>
        ...
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore <m>x\in B</m>
    </p>
  </assemblage>
  <p>
    The keen-eyed student will notice that this is simply the direct proof applied to the definition of subset, specifically:
    <me>
        \forall x\in\mathcal{U} \text{ }x\in A\implies x\in B
    </me>
    We will see many examples of this proving method throughout out the class, yet before we jump in, I'd like to note for either the instructor or the diligent student who has been paying very close attention to the journey. I used to try and teach this by taking away the numbers, and instead using the <m>{\color{red}\text{beginning}}</m>, <m>{\color{green}\text{muddle}}</m> and the <m>{\color{blue}\text{end}}</m> in <xref ref="subsec-5-3-2-algebra-of-sets"/> instead of the now off-handed way you see presented here, but I believe the students felt like it was too jarring and then leaned away from subsets and set proofs, which was detrimental to their learning once we got to abstract algebra. So now I introduce these proofs with numbers in hopes that you leave the set theory section with the love that you left from the even and odd proofs.

    <title>The First Proof</title>
  <p>
    Define the sets 
    <me>
        A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=6a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
    </me>
    <me>
        B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
    </me>
    <alert>Prove:</alert> <m>A\subseteq B</m>
</p>
<p>Before we begin any proof we sing our song (play-along):</p>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{red}{P}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>x\in A</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What's the <m>{\color{blue}{Q}}</m>?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p><m>x\in B</m></p>
    </answer>
    <p>"What're the definitions?" </p>
    <answer>
    <p>The definition of the sets written directly above silly goose!</p>
    </answer>
    <p>"Now, what to do?"</p> 
    <answer>
    <p>A direct proof! (proof of a subset!)</p>
    </answer>
    
    
    <p></p>
    <section xml:id="sec-5-4-2-begin" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <title><m>{\color{red}{\text{The Beginning}}}</m></title>
        <p>
            To begin this proof we follow our procedure above, by choosing an arbitrary element of the set <m>A</m>, using words in the manner of:
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\color{red}{\text{Let }s\in A}</me> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Thats all there is to it, we abscond with a random element of <m>A</m>, then drudge forward with our journey to show it is a member of <m>B</m>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="sec-5-4-3-muddle" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <title><m>{\color{green}{\text{The Muddle}}}</m></title>
        <p>
            I chose to begin with this example as <m>\color{green}{\text{the muddle}}</m> is almost identical to most other of our examples. That is we simply state what it takes for <m>s</m> to belong to <m>A</m>. From the definition above of the set <m>A</m>, we see in the <em>condition</em> part of the set-builder notation it tells us that there must be an integer so that <m>s</m> is 6 times this integer (sound familiar?). To invoke this we could write something like:
        </p>
        <p>
            By the definition of membership of <m>A</m>, we can produce some integer <m>t</m> so that <m>s=6t</m>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="sec-5-4-4-end" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <title><m>{\color{blue}{\text{The End}}}</m></title>
        <p>
            Now, for the end we need to finally get to the finish line, that is finally conclude that our element <m>s</m> is indeed a member of <m>B</m>. For this notice that 
            <me>
              s=6t=2\cdot(3t)  
            </me>
            and since 3 is an integer and <m>t</m> is an integer we have that <m>3t</m> is an integer and hence <m>s</m> satisfies the condition to be in <m>B</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we present it all in one place.
        </p>
        <example>
            <p>
                Define the sets 
                <me>
                    A=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=6a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
                </me>
                <me>
                    B=\{x\in\Z\text{ }|\text{ }x=2a\text{ for some } a\in\Z\}
                </me>
                <alert>Prove:</alert> <m>A\subseteq B</m>
            </p>
            <p>
                Proof:
            </p>
            <p>
                Let <m>s\in A</m>, by definition of the set <m>A</m> we can find an integer <m>t</m> so that <m>s=6t</m>, yet note since <m>6=2\cdot 3</m> we have <m>s=6t=2\cdot(3t)</m>. Now, since <m>3</m> and <m>t</m> are integers we can conclude <m>3t</m> is an integer. Therefore by the definition of the set <m>B</m> we have that <m>s\in B</m>
            </p>

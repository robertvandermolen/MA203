<p>The purpose for the course/book is to help the student that is about to transition 
    from the traditional calculative courses, such as the calculus sequence, and begin their journey into 
    the more abstract mathematics where proofs become prevalent.</p>
    <p>
        Most students that would venture this far into the 
        mathematics major have been enjoying these calculative classes, enjoying the comfort of an algorithm. Perhaps they were the 
        student that loved Calculus III, where they pictured three dimensional shapes and loved the visualization. Whatever
        it was I have seen far too many students then reach the more "rigorous" classes and loose interest, change 
        majors or just stop enjoying mathematics. In my opinion this is just a shame! And this text tries to give students
        an algorithm to hold on to as they move deeper and deeper into the muddle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This transition from calculative to proving is why I choose instead of a combinatorial based course, such as discrete mathematics, we take our trip in the calculus student's favorite past time of numbers. So the student can rest assured that numbers are at the forefront of this course, even though we are exploring new and exciting paths where numbers may not take a leading role.

<p><alert>To the Teacher:</alert></p>
<p>I don't know how you stumbled upon this book, but if you are reading this
    you are most likely deciding if you should adopt this textbook in your class.
    I'll save you the work: DO IT! 
</p>
<p>
    What? Are you still reading? Ohhh... you want more of an explanation. Well, first
    this book is free, stop making your students pay for expensive books! 
</p>
<p>
    Still here I see... You are more discerning. Well if you want to know if my exercises are of your taste, 
    I assure you I broke no molds in the exercises. In this textbook Students will prove the traditional even, odd, divides, etc. 
</p>
<p>
    Wait... you are still reading... ok people might ask what you are doing... quick giggle and say:  
</p>
<p>
    "that's a funny tiktok" 
</p>
<p>
    That was close... didn't want your colleagues walking by to think you actually cared about student learning... so you want to know if this is different than those other introduction
    to proofs books... Well let me tell you a story...
</p>
<p>I've had nights out at conferences with fellow mathematicians and have listened to 
    these brilliant mathematicians lament on not understanding the purpose of a course
    on proof writing. And when these pillars of our mathematics community ever taught such a class it was with
    the outlook that someone learned to write proofs by seeing a lot of proofs. So the instructor would show off some proofs
    never really motivating why or how one would move from one line to the next then grab some questions from the exercise
    section and just hope their students would figure it out. 
</p>
<p>
    By my flippant description of this interaction you probably put together that I don't feel this way. I feel like students
    can be led on the proving journey the same as they are led on their calculative journey. Just more care should
    be taken. I have attempted to create a text that allows the instructor to just "follow the chapters" in their present
    order and hopefully give the student's this journey!
</p>
<p>
    Ok... but you are still reading... Yes, you may be asking why are my examples so "basic" I never once mention derivative 
    like the popular texts in this subject by the big publishers... well this is because I save that for analysis... in
    this course I am just trying to introduce proving, not introduce topics that cannot be picked up (almost) immediately. While these pithy examples can mislead the students that are still trying to "just get the answer" it is my hope that the treatment of these examples is what sets it apart.
</p>
<p>
    Now, if you are curious of my ethos/outlook on proofs or that of advanced/abstract mathematics to see if it
    aligns with yours and you have yet been scared away by this preface, then I can only assume that you either know me personally and are wondering if this rampant rambling will ever end, or did he just blindly type on a keyboard and expect no one to ever read this. But perhaps brave traveler, you are like me and are actually wondering...
    <me>
        \text{How do you teach someone how to prove?}
    </me>
    If you continue to read you will see that I wax poetic about undefined terms and tracing back conclusions to our assumptions, axioms and definitions... if this is all true then why not just teach a student to prove with a course in geometry? Or if this approach is too archaic, start with a discrete math course where you can introduce them to fun brand new concepts like graphs and latin squares where they can start from first principles? 
</p>
<p>
    These are both amazing thoughts and in my personal opinion amazing classes, yet to go a little deeper than I had earlier in this preface, to me a discrete math course can take a lot of time playing with and learning these new concepts, and the proofs are a side-kick to the combinatorics, which is awesome to the combinatorics lover, and this indeed can often soften the blow between the calculus and the notorious math major courses. The problem is that the student will still feel lost in their algebra and analysis and what happens a lot is the student shy's away from these subjects and clings to combinatorics where they first got those <em>good grades</em> or where they first felt <em>smart</em>. Yet, in this weird class which <em>feels like</em> it teaches them nothing new, its real goal is to make them look at the things they already knew differently, by giving them their college algebra to play with not only for a <em>safety blanket</em> ()as I will quite often refer to it) but in hopes to give them the space and time needed to see the deepness of the pond of proofs they are now peering into.

<p>
    But... of course the critical reader, as I am sure you are, combined with years of mathematical knowledge, as I also assume you have, might just say: "wait isn't this just a baby's first number theory course?"
</p>
<p>
    To which I scoff, a scoff more deeply than I have ever scoffed...
</p>
<p>
    If you have read this far, I'm sure you have already looked me up... but I'm definitely not a number theorist... sorry in advance!
